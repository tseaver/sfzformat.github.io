    "body": "Here some tips for adding multimedia content into this website pages. Images: Usually in markdown format, images are added as the following: ![Alternate text](/path/to/image)This might be enough when the image is made with a resolution that can adapteasily to the page context, by having also some stylesheet support for scalingon various media devices. But this is not always the case when we need to integrate differently themedia content, so some additional code is required. Markdown permits embedded HTML, to give some ability to use traditional codefor the web pages. This website uses bootstrap, so some helper classes are available, likeimg-fluid (see the weblink for details). Galleries: There are many implementations available in internet able to display variousmultimedia galleries, which can contain not only images but also videos. ekko-lightbox was choosed, that seems to well integrate with bootstrap. A helper function to made the process easier, avoiding to add more lines of codeinto the content, is available at _includes/lightbox_gallery. liquid. Add the following Liquid code in the place you want to add your gallery: {%-assign images =  my_image1. jpg,my_other_image2. png,another_img. gif  | split: ','-%}{%-assign titles =  Image 1 alt text,,Some alt text for the gif  | split: ','-%}{%-assign gallery =  gallery-name -%}{%-assign path  =  /relative/path/to/images/ -%}{%-include lightbox_gallery. liquid const_images=images const_titles=titles const_gallery=gallery const_path=path-%}Note that images and titles arrays want to be the same number of elementsbecause they share the same loop, so an unused alternate text must be anempty element between two commas. The arrays are passed as a single string each, so don’t add spaces between commas,or they will be added to the image path, resulting to a 404. "

    "title": "Intro to SFZ",
    "body": "A SFZ file is a set of plain text, computer-readable instructions, whichaccompany a sample set and define how the sampler should load and work withthose samples. If the samples are the strings of a piano or pipes of an organ,the SFZ file is the mechanism that connects the key to the hammer which strikesthe strings or the air and signals to the pipes of the organ. SFZ files can be opened, edited, and created in any text editor application,even the default ‘Notepad’ in Windows. No external software is necessaryto create or modify a SFZ file, though there are some pieces of softwareor scripts out there which greatly ease the creation or editing process. An example of this is an automapper, which is a script or application that takesa sample set and uses the names of the samples or actual audio contentto determine how to map those samples. Opcodes: The primary component of any SFZ file is the opcode. Opcodes essentially define‘thing=value’. For example, the opcode ‘volume=6’ defines the volumeof the sample as +6 decibels relative to normal. Opcodes functionally perform two different roles: defining performance properties,or restricting the conditions under which that sound may be used. For example,‘volume=6’ defines a performance property: the sample will sound 6 decibels louder. On the other hand, ‘lokey=36 hikey=38’ limits what conditionthe sound may play: the key must be 36, 37, or 38. If using a pitch based instrument, you will most likely be working heavily withthree opcodes: lokey, hikey, and pitch_keycenter. These opcodes define the rangeof MIDI note numbers or note names that will allow the note to play. It is highly recommended that you use MIDI note numbers, as pitch namingconventions are poorly standardized at best. You can remember the MIDI note numbers for the C’s as follows,using International Pitch Notation, which states C4=MIDI note number 60: C1:24C2: 36 (this is the C below bass clef)C3: 48 (this is the C in bass clef)C4: 60 (this is Middle C)C5: 72 (this is the C in treble clef)C6: 84 (this is the C above treble clef)C7: 96(note that many, many samplers use a different standard of C3=60,in which case all numbers are shifted down one) You’ll notice each value is exactly 12 notes apart from the others. It’s not too difficult to calculate notes between the C’s, or keep a charton your wall or desk with the note names and MIDI numbers listed out. Many hours have been saved debugging and mapping for me in this way. Headers: Headers serve to organize and separate opcodes, and are marked with &lt; &gt;on either side. There are three primary headers: &lt;region&gt;, &lt;group&gt;,and &lt;global&gt;, from most to least restrictive. A region, for example,may only contain a single sample. A group is comprised of a series of regions,each containing a single sample. A global is comprised of a series of groups,each containing a series of regions, etc. &lt;control&gt; is a special purpose header used for a few special opcodessuch as default_path. Generally SFZ instruments are not indented, but if they were,they would appear as such: &lt;control&gt;&lt;global&gt;	&lt;group&gt;		&lt;region&gt;			sample=		&lt;region&gt;			sample=	&lt;group&gt;		&lt;region&gt;			sample=		&lt;region&gt;			sample=Note that if you entered an opcode between a &lt;group&gt; and its first &lt;region&gt;,that opcode would be inherited by the &lt;regions&gt; within the group. The same can be done for &lt;global&gt; as well, allowing the parameters of dozens,hundreds, or thousands of samples to be altered with a single line. This behavior can be overriden if that same opcode is specified withinthe lesser header with a different value. For example: &lt;global&gt;	volume=6	&lt;group&gt; //Group A		volume=5		&lt;region&gt; //Region 1			volume=4		&lt;region&gt; //Region 2	&lt;group&gt; //Group B		&lt;region&gt; //Region 3			volume=2		&lt;region&gt; //Region 4Here’s what’s going on here:  Region 1’s volume is 4, as it has volume defined.  Region 2’s volume is 5, as it doesn’t have volume defined,so it inherits from Group A, as Group A has volume defined.  Region 3’s volume is 2, as it has volume defined.  Region 4’s volume is 6 as it doesn’t have volume defined, nor does Group B,so it inherits from the Global volume setting which is 6. Always look for opportunities to use inheriting to keep your scripts tidyby removing duplicate code. "

One major exception are brush techniques which involve scraping thebrush across a drum head, often in a circle. If you are not sure what thislooks or sounds like, this video is a good guide. These techniques are called swirls or stirs, and for the purpose of this articlewe’ll call them stirs. As the sound changes in intensity, and the durationof the scrapes needs to fit the tempo and rhythm of the song, sampling themrequires a different approach to the usual drum hits. The two common approachesare to completely ignore this technique and not sample it at all, and to recordloops to fit various tempos. This article describes another approach. The key principle hereis that stirs are a noisy, nonlinear sound with a lot of randomness, whichmakes them very easy to crossfade or loop with no phase issues. Therefore,instead of trying to record stirs performed in a realistic way, we proposerecording long, unrealistically steady stirs with no perceptible rhythm orexpression, and then using those samples as source material for building upa musical stir. Recording the source material: For the purposes of this example, let’s assume the source stirs are recordedat four speeds, with 1 being the slowest and 4 being the fastest. Speed 1 isslow enough that a full circle around the head of the drum is completed inmore than 4 seconds. That’s enough to fill a measure at 60 bpm and still havesome sound left, so the user can start the next stir before the previous oneends, and thus achieve a continuous sound. Speed 4 is several circles persecond, to match the speed at which the brush would be moving during the peakof an aggressive stir. Making the sound steady at this speed is a challenge. As for how long the recordings need to be, speed 1 needs to be long enoughfor the longest stir we want to be able to make. However, if tuning controlsare to be applied, it’s important to remember that pitching a sample upshortens it, so if the tuning range is to extend to one octave up, then a10-second sample is the minimum to make a 5-second stir. Speeds 3 and 4are not used thorughout the duration of a stir but only for peaks, and forthe purposes of this example they can be half the length of speed 1. Simple stir model: We can make a very simple stir using speed 1 by playing the sample withloop_mode set to one_shot, like we normally would set it for adrum hit, and using a simple volume envelopeto fade this sample in over a time, and then fade it out. &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=1. 0 ampeg_decay=1. 0 ampeg_sustain=0The resulting volume envelope will look something like this. The illustrations arenot precise, only general shapes.  This is a good start, and we can add expression and realism by layering afaster speed on top of it near the stir’s peak, with half the durationof the base layer. We use ampeg_delay to delay the start of the secondlayer by the same amount, so the peaks of both layers align in time. &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=1. 0 ampeg_decay=1. 0 ampeg_sustain=0&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 5 ampeg_attack=0. 5 ampeg_decay=0. 5 ampeg_sustain=0 Modulating stir duration: This has a fixed duration and is not flexible, but the stir length caneasily be modulated by a single CC parameter changing all theenvelope durations. Extremely short stirs, lasting only a small fractionof a second, are obviously not going to sound realistic, so we can usea minimum value to prevent that. Let’s use CC1 (standard mod wheel). &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 1 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 4 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25Making the shape more realistic: Drummers testing the above model have asked for some adjustments tomake it sound more realistic. One is to make the first half of the baselayer steadier. This can be done very easily by shortening the attackand adding a hold time to the envelope, ensuring that they still add upto the same amount of time that the faster layer’s delay and attack,so the peak will remain aligned at all values of the modulationparameter. The attack stage should generally be shorter than the holdstage. &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25 Also, the peak should be sharper and more accented than it iswith linear envelopes. Changing the envelope curves accomplishes this,though the initial attack envelope of the base layer can remainlinear. The below values seem like a decent start. &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4 Adjusting the envelope shapes: The above fixed envelope shapes are good for medium tempos and energy levels,but for slow tempos the flat envelope shapes actually work quite well, andmore energetic tracks might sound better with even sharper envelope peaks. Itwould be nice to adjust the envelope curve shapes with MIDI CC, but it is notcurrently possible to do this. It’s possible to work around this by crossfadingsharp-envelope and flat-envelope regions, or use locc/hicc to select betweenseveral pre-baked envelope shapes. Here’s anexample of the latter method. &lt;group&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5Adding ornaments: So far, we have a stir with adjustable duration and shape which peakshalfway through. More complex patterns can have more than one peak,though. A simple way to emulate that is to use a differnet MIDI noteto trigger short ornaments which will add a brief extra sound to thestir, thus emulating a momentary acceleration of the brush. We can useone of the higher stir speeds for this. &lt;group&gt;key=27 loop_mode=one_shot sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 2 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5Accents: We can also create accents, which are similar to the typical stir but peak muchmore quickly and use faster speeds. In pracitce, they can be used either asshort, aggressive stirs, or added on top of basic stirs to create more complexpatterns. The difference in the SFZ here is that the attack curve shape can be applied tothe attack portion as well, and there is no hold stage in the envelope. &lt;group&gt;key=28 loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5Muting: As all the above sounds have loop_mode set to one_shot, triggering a note causesthe sound to play until the volume envelope drops to zero. If ending a stirearlier than that is required, we can use polyphony groups. The group and off_byopcodes are the key ones here. We can use them to make stirs self-mute, so thattriggering a new stir will mute any previously playing stirs, as well as add a keywhich produces no sound, using silence instead of a sample, butis in the same mute groups, so triggering this key will mute any stir or accentcurrently playing. This key can be used to stop stirs early. Note that, as usual, separate groups are needed forlayers which are to play simultaneously, and if there are multiple microphonepositions then those would need separate groups as well. In the below example wealso have stirs mute accents, and vice versa, although the ornaments are leftout of the mute groups and can be layered on top of other sounds without muting them. For a more sophisticated use of mute groups with other pieces of the drum kit,please see cymbal muting. &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot off_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 1 ampeg_releasecc1=0. 2&lt;group&gt;key=26&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0group=2 off_by=2&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4group=2 off_by=2&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5group=2 off_by=2&lt;group&gt;key=27 sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 2 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5&lt;group&gt;key=28&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0group=2 off_by=2&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4group=2 off_by=2&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5group=2 off_by=2&lt;group&gt;key=29 sample=*silence&lt;region&gt;group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;group=2 off_by=2It is, of course, possible to apply round robins and dynamic layers to this,just like any other drum sound. That is left as an exercise to the reader. Alternative approach: The above approach was developed to be playable from an electronic drum kitcontroller. For keyboard controllers or sequencing, another approach is possiblewhere instead of using a MIDI note to trigger a new stir every time the drummerwould complete a circle, we hold down a long note for as long as we want to producestirs (so, possibly for several measures, or even the entire duration of a song). We then use MIDI CC to crossfade between the layers tomodulate the speed of the stir in order to create realism and rhythmic interest. In order to be able to do this, the samples will have to be looped, but as statedat the beginning, looping or crossfading noisy samples is very easy as there areno phase issues. We also set the loop_mode opcode to continuousinstead of the one_shot setting used in the earlier approach. &lt;group&gt;key=26 loop_mode=continuous ampeg_release=0. 25&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=31 xfout_locc1=32 xfout_hicc1=63&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wav xfin_locc1=32 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=95&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=95 xfout_locc1=96 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wav xfin_locc1=96 xfin_hicc1=127In practice, this approach has proven more difficult to use, with it being easyto sound obviously unrealistic by moving the MIDI CC parameter too quickly orstaying at high values for too long. With care, however, it can produce realisticresults, and it is extremely flexible. Further possibilities: The brush flutter technique can be treated similarly to the base layer of the stirs. There is no need to layer faster and slower flutters. In theory, this approachcould also be extended to other noisy, highly nonlinear sounds which can varyin duration - perhaps shakers. The main challenge there would be to record shakersshaking smoothly for an extended duration. It is also certainly possible to further improve the above model with more realismand playablity. "

    "body": "A lot of the information in this article deals with implementing sampled hi-hatsand cymbals in general, and although the code examples are in SFZ, the principlesshould also apply to other samplers, or even synthesized cymbals. Muting previously played notes is important with monophonic instruments, such asflutes or trumpets. With hi-hats, it is also crucial to sounding like a hi-hat -an open hi-hat hit will be muted in real life when the hi-hat pedal is closed. Let’s start with a simple hi-hat with closed hit, foot chik, half-open and opensamples, with the latter two on the same key and degree of openness selected byMIDI CC 4 - the common hi-hat pedal assignment in electronic drum kits. &lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64Simple self-muting: The above hi-hat has no muting implemented, so playinga closed hit after an open one would result in the open hit unrealisticallycontinuing to ring. The simplest way to take care of that is to put all theregions in the same ‹group› and use off_byto make that group mute itself - thatwill mean any hi-hat hit will mute any currently playing hi-hat hit. Setting off_mode to normal and using ampeg_releaseor off_time to set the time it takes forthe previous sample to fade out also helps this sound a bit more natural. &lt;group&gt;off_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=1Hierarchical self-muting: This is the way many virtual drum kits work, but it is not fully satisfactory if,for example, playing a ride pattern on an open hi-hat. Things do start getting morecomplicated here, though, and many developers feel that it’s enough to stop here, justimplement the above rules, and have a reasonably working virtual hi-hat. For thosewho want more, however, Peter L. Jones has developed a hierarchy of muting, wherehits which are more closed mute hits that are more open, but hits which aremore open do not mute hits which are more closed. Hits also don’t mute hits withthe same degree of openness. So, chiks mute all hits, closed hits mute any partially open hits but not chiksor closed hits etc. With this amount of degrees of openness, half-open hits wouldmute open hits, and open hits would mute nothing. So, we need to put each hi-hatarticulation in a different group. This, however, means we need a group whichmutes several other groups, and regions in a group cannot have multiple orvarying off_by values. So, what we have to do is use silence - either the silence*setting of sample ARIA extension, or an actual file ofa short silence. Note that the silence samples also have to have off_by settingsthe same as the hi-hat samples in their mute group. Also, since group 1 doesn’tmute anything, we don’t need to add any silence regions to that group. Note that the group opcode used here and the ‹group›header are completely separate concepts - “group” for the remainder of thisarticle refers to the opcode, not the header, though group headers are also usedin the code examples. &lt;group&gt;// Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=3 off_by=4&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=4&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=2 off_by=3&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=2&lt;group&gt;group=2 off_by=3// The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4// The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed and chikloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;group&gt;group=4// The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chikloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Special treatment of foot splashes: The above isn’t perfect - for example, fully opening up a hi-hat after playinga hard half-open hit in the real world would stop the clashes between the topand bottom, effectively stopping a half-open sound and replacing it with quieteropen ringing - but it is a reasonable compromise covering various degrees ofopenness. Also, the more degrees of openness there are, the more groups will be needed. There are, however, more hi-hat articulations possible. One which has specialbehavior when it comes to muting is the foot splash - closing the hi-hat withthe pedal, then quickly reopening it. This articulation needs to mute itself,because playing one foot splash after another involves closing the hi-hat, whichwill mute the ringing. It should also mute just about everything else, exceptfor possibly foot chiks, because it invovles closing the hi-hat fully. So, if akit has foot splash samples (for which there is no standard general MIDI noteassignment, so let’s use 54 here - an octave above the chik, though in generalMIDI that’s supposed to be the cowbell note), we’d need to set up one more group,and have that mute itself. It will also need to be muted by all other types ofhi-hat hits, except for fully open hits. &lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=4 off_by=5&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=5&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes - everything except open and foot splash//Foot splash mutes itself, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples themselves are in the same groupsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4//The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54Limiting polyphony: This works reasonably well. Another potential refinement is to also avoidexcessive buildup when the more open articulations (which with some hi-hat pairscan ring for upwards of 20 seconds), while still allowing enough for ridepatterns on an open hi-hat to sound right. We can do this by using the polyphonyopcode to put a limit on the number of polyphony voices used by a specific group. Note this must be set for the silence regions, also, so that every region in agroup will have the same off_by and polyphony as all the other regions in thatgroup. Polyphony of 4 for the open hi-hats and 3 for the half-open are judgmentcalls. Drier cymbals and articulations with less sustain will generally soundrealistic with lower numbers here, and brushes might need a lower number thansticks. Limiting the polyphony for the more closed articulations is not necessaryin practice, unless playing unrealistically dense trap hi-hat patterns, becausethey don’t ring very long anyway. Limiting the polyphony for the foot splash isnot necessary at all, because it mutes itself. &lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=4 off_by=5&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=5&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=4&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes//All sounds except open mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3//The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except open and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Edge cases: The above can sound strange when a hard hi-hat hit is being muted by a much quieter one. Ifthe hit doing the muting is both quiet and short, it can be practically inaudible, and theresulting sound seems to only be the open hit, suddenly fading out. This is especially riskyif using amp_veltrack set to 100, which will make hits with very low velocity extremely quiet,or if the lowest dynamic layers of more closed hits and foot chiks are recorded very quietly. Lowering amp_veltrack for the lowest velocity layers is one potential way to reduce thisproblem, as is setting amp_velcurve_1 to some value around 0. 2 to 0. 5 (higher values if thereare more dynamic layers). In real life, however, a hard open hi-hat hit would have reduced in volume before the startof the soft closed hit, as the pedal needs to be closed before a closed hit can be made. This would, of course, cause many edge clashes along the way, which we do not have a wayto emulate. However, it is possible to use the pedal’s MIDI CC to make the open sample quieteroutside of the range where the open hi-hat sample would be triggered. This can be done by modulatingthe hi-hat’s amplitude, and applying a curve which willkeep the amplitude at 100% unless the pedal is a good deal more closed than it was when the samplewas triggered. &lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=4 off_by=5&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=5&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 amplitude_cc4=100 amplitude_curvecc4=21 amplitude_smoothcc4=150&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 amplitude_cc4=100 amplitude_curvecc4=21 amplitude_smoothcc4=150&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;curve&gt;curve_index=21v000=0. 13v037=0. 8v077=1v127=1&lt;curve&gt;curve_index=22v000=0. 1v037=0. 7v077=1v127=1Using smoothing on the amplitude modulation helps avoid sudden jumps, though playing anopen hit, closing the hi-hat pedal most of the way and then reopening it will stillresult in obviously unrealistic volume fluctuations. So, this is not a perfect solutionby any means. It’s probably better to do this by using a volume envelope and using CC4 to modulate itsdecay time, with the sustain set to a low level. and the ampeg_dynamicopcode set to 1 so that moving the pedal will cause the decay time to be recalculated. However, that has not been tested yet, as the author’s test kit was already using envelopeson the hi-hat to emulate drier cymbals. Also, applying this to splash samples, which involve the pedal starting closed and openingrapidly, is another problem which requires a solution. Multimic samples: So far, each hi-hat articulation has only one sample, which will obviously notbe the case in most virtual drum kits. This does not add much complexity, though,as the samples for each degree of openness simply need to all be in the same group. All half-open samples, for example, including all round robins, all velocity layers,can share the same group. If there are separate articulations for each degree of openness, such as shank,tip and bell, those can also all be on the same group. Brushes, sticks andmallets can often also share the same groups, unless the brushes need lowerpolyphony numbers. However, if there are separate samples for differentmicrophones and the groups are self-muting, they will need to be in differentgroups. In the current example, only the footsplash is self-muting, but if usingthe simpler rules where all hi-hat articulations mute all others, all groups areself-muting. So, having separate close hi-hat mic and a stereo overhead pairwould mean twice as many of those groups (assuming the stereo overheads are inthe L and R channel of the same sample), and close hi-hat, stereo overheads,close room and far room would mean four times as many. The polyphony numbers forgroups which have polyphony will also have to be multiplied by the same factor. Here is an example with close and overhead, with slightly longer fadeout timesfor the more distant overhead mics: &lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normal&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed_close. wav group=4 off_by=5 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed_oh. wav group=4 off_by=5 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik_close. wav group=5 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik_oh. wav group=5 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open_close. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open_oh. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open_close. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=8 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open_oh. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=8 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash_close. wav group=1 off_by=1 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash_oh. wav group=11 off_by=11 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes for the close mic//All sounds except open mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=11 off_by=11//The range which mutes foot splashes for the overhead mics//All sounds mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3//The range which mutes open hi-hats for both close and overhead mics - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chiksample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Header organization: That is as complex as it gets, though there are a few minor points to be aware of. Many drum kits with round robins will set seq_lengthat the ‹global› level, and in those cases, the silence regionswould only trigger for the first hit in the round robin sequence, unless theyhave seq_length set to 1 to override the global setting. Also, the ‹master›header level and #include statement are useful ARIAextensions for keeping deeply sampled hi-hat mappings organized. Cymbals other than hi-hats: Cymbals other than hi-hats are simpler, but there aretwo considerations when muting those. One is limiting polyphony, which isespecially important with cymbals intended for playing rolls, and with jazz ridecymbals (rock/metal rides which primarily use the bell articulation, not as much). The other is that it’s also possible to record separate choke samples, and havethose mute everything else. A ride with bell, bow and edge articulations, chokesamples and overhead and room mics might be set up like below. Note that whileeach articulation has its own groups and different polyphony limits, allarticulations for each mic have the same off_by value, which is the group valueof the choke samples for that mic. It would not be necessary to have this manygroups to implement muting, but this setup would also allow a mapping using onlythe overhead mics and no room mic to be created without breaking anything, aseach mic’s samples have separate groups. Having different polyphony numbers fordifferent mics can result in an inconsistent sound, so it is not recommended. &lt;group&gt;off_mode=normal//Bow hits&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=30 off_by=33 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_bow_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=40 off_by=43 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_bow_rm. wav//Bell hits&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=31 off_by=33 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_bell_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=41 off_by=43 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_bell_rm. wav//Edge hits (crashes)&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=32 off_by=33 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_edge_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=42 off_by=43 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_edge_rm. wav//Edge chokes&lt;region&gt;key=71 ampeg_attack=0. 15 group=33sample=ride_choke_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=71 ampeg_attack=0. 15 group=43sample=ride_choke_rm. wavAnother approach to limiting polyphony: If there is no need have a choke group, it’s possible to limit the polyphony ofa cymbal in a way which is more controllable, by having it self-mute but makingthe fadeout time of the previous samples long. This cannot be done when chokesare required, because chokes need a fast fadeout, but it is another option whichallows how much dense patterns on a cymbal will build up to be controlled with aMIDI CC parameter - the polyphony opcode cannot be modulated by MIDI CC, butampeg_release can. Here is how that might work using CC 100 to modulate the time,with different maximum times for different articulations, as in general edge hitswill build up the most and bell hits the least. Of course, it’s not very possibleto modulate the buildup of a cymbal in the real world, but that doesn’t mean itcan’t be useful in the sampled world. &lt;group&gt;off_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 1//Bow hits&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=30 off_by=30ampeg_release_oncc100=5sample=ride_bow_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=40 off_by=40ampeg_release_oncc100=5. 7sample=ride_bow_rm. wav//Bell hits&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=31 off_by=31ampeg_release_oncc100=3sample=ride_bell_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=41 off_by=41ampeg_release_oncc100=3. 5sample=ride_bell_rm. wav//Edge hits (crashes)&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=32 off_by=32ampeg_release_oncc100=7sample=ride_edge_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=42 off_by=42ampeg_release_oncc100=8sample=ride_edge_rm. wavDeep-sampled hi-hat example: Putting most of the above knowledge together into a complex example can resultin long SFZ files, but the principles themselves remain the same.

Using #define as a constant with a single value thorughout an instrument workseasily. Defining the same variable to have multiple values at different points in thesame instrument, however, requires care. Using #define to set the same variable todifferent values at one point in the same SFZ file does not work well at least inARIA/Sforzando when loading an instrument. However, a workaround there is touse #include to put each set of #define statements with differentvalues in a separate file.  In simple tests, that has been successful. "

    "body": "SFZ has a lot of opcodes. No instrument uses all of them, though, and even highlycomplicated instruments with thousands of samples will usually only use a dozenor two different opcodes. In this guide, we’ll talk about the opcodes needed to make a simple drum kit. If you have some drum samples, a text editor and an SFZ player, this should beall the knowledge you need to make a working SFZ mapping for those samples. Most of them will apply to most other instrument types as well. Later, we’llapply this knowledge to instruments such as piano, guitar, violin and flute. A very simple instrument to make would be an electronic drum kit with one samplefor each sound. A functional mapping for an entire sampled drum machine usingone-shot samples could be made using only the region header, and two opcodessample and key. With kick, snareand hi-hat samples on their standard General MIDI notes, this could be theentire SFZ file: &lt;region&gt;key=36 sample=kick. wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 sample=snare. wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=closedhat. wavThis would work. Load this into an SFZ player, hit the C on MIDI note 36, andyou get the kick sample playing. However, each sound would play only while anote is held. With drums it’s usually a good idea to play the entire sample, soa very short note will result in a complete drum hit sounding. We can do thatwith the loop_mode opcode, which is also used forlooping (as the name implies), but loop_mode=one_shot causes the sampler toplay the entire sample from start to end, ignoring note off. &lt;region&gt;key=36 loop_mode=one_shot sample=kick. wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 loop_mode=one_shot sample=snare. wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 loop_mode=one_shot sample=closedhat. wavThere’s no need to set the one_shot for each region, though. We can simplifyour life by using the ‹global› header like this: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;key=36 sample=kick. wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 sample=snare. wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=closedhat. wavThis is basically all that’s required to take, for example, some ofWave Alchemy’s very nice free samples of TR-808 or Tanzbar drum machines,and make a working SFZ mapping for them. Let’s say what we have isn’t drum machine samples, but acoustic drum samples. These sounds will have natural variation between hits - some depending on hitlocation, a lot depending on dynamics (how hard the drum is hit), and some justplain random. Let’s ignore controlling hit location for now (drum samples mostlydo ignore it), and focus on the other two. Dynamic variation can be captured byrecording hits of various intensity, and organizing them into dynamic layers,also called velocity layers. If we have an acoustic kick drum sampled at four dynamics - quiet, kind of quiet,kind of loud and loud - we have four dynamic layers. Let’s say the files forthese layers are named like this: kick_vl1. wavkick_vl2. wavkick_vl3. wavkick_vl4. wavTo trigger the quiet sample at low MIDI note velocities, we’d use thelovel and hivel opcodes like this: &lt;region&gt;key=36 lovel=0 hivel=31 sample=kick_vl1. wavAll four hits with velocity ranges assigned, evenly splitting the full 0 to 127velocity range into four, would look like this: &lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=0 hivel=31sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=32 hivel=63sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=64 hivel=95sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=96 hivel=127sample=kick_vl4. wavThis can, again, be simplified. The defalut value for lovel is 0, and for hivelit’s 127, so we don’t need to specify setting them to those numbers. Also, wecan use a ‹group› header to make the key opcode the sameacross all four regions: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36&lt;region&gt;hivel=31 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavHowever, the quiet samples will play quieter than they should - because ofstandard velocity tracking, each sample would play at full volume if thevelocity was 127, but we actually need each sample to play at full volume at thevelocity which is equal to its hivel value. This can be done in various ways,and the way we recommend is the amp_velcurve_Nopcode, like this: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36&lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavLet’s say that each dynamic layer also contains four round robins - four sampleswith roughly the same dynamic. This allows us to include some variation, andsound more natural - fast parts won’t sound like a “machine gun”. There are twobasic ways to put round robins to use. One is to use the seq_lengthand seq_position opcodes, like this: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl2_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl2_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl2_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl2_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl3_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl3_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl3_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl3_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl4_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl4_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl4_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl4_rr4. wavThat’s a kick drum with four dynamic layers and four sequential round robins. As you might have noticed, we’re repeating the key=36 and seq_length=4 opcodesin every group. Those two opcodes could be moved to the global level if all wewanted was a kick drum, but as we’re going to have other instruments with otherkeys and possibly different numbers of round robins, we kept them at the grouplevel. The other way to use round robins is randomized, using thelorand and hirand opcodes. This will make the sampleplayer generate a random number, then play the region whose lorand to hirandrange includes that random number. Whether robins should be used in this randomway or the above sequential way, the answer is “it depends”. It seems that moreinstruments use sequential, though. This is how random round robins would beset up for our kick drum samples: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl2_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl2_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl2_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl2_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl3_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl3_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl3_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl3_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96&lt;region&gt;hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl4_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl4_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl4_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl4_rr4. wavIf we go back to sequential round robins and add a snare with onlythree round robins, plus a few comments, the resulting SFZ would look like this: // This is an example of a basic drum kit mapping// All samples set to play in their entirety when a note is received&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot// This is the kick, on MIDI note 36, with four dynamic layers and four round robins&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl2_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl2_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl2_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl2_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl3_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl3_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl3_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl3_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl4_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl4_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl4_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl4_rr4. wav// Here is the snare, on MIDI note 38, with four dynamic layers and three round robins&lt;group&gt;key=38 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl2_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl2_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl2_rr3. wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl3_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl3_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl3_rr3. wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=96 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl4_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl4_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl4_rr3. wavThis is almost all the information needed to map basic drum kits in SFZ.

Marking a region end with -1 canbe used to use a silent region to turn off other regions by using the groupand off_by opcodes. In certain cases, possibly due to ill-formed WAV files,setting end to -1 can cause errors, but setting loop_mode to no_loop orone_shot seems to be a workaround. A region which does not play is still triggered, however, which means it can muteother regions. When using sample=*silence it is very useful to set end=-1(or a zero-duration volume envelope with zero sutain) so the silence region does notcontinue to play and does not use up a polyphony voice. Another way to accomplishthe same thing is to use an ampeg envelope wiht zero ampeg_attack,ampeg_decay and ampeg_sustain. Examples: end=133000end=4432425end=-1"

    "title": "Envelope Generators",
    "body": "Envelope generators (EGs) are used to control the profile of the volume, filter, pitch, or other parameter, based on the timing of the key press and release(including sustain/sostenudo pedal release. ) These are often called “ADSRs”,after the four parameters (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) that were usedto control envelopes in early synthesizers (and many current ones as well. ) See SFZ1 Modulations to see examples of how these can be applied. SFZ has two types of EGs: SF1 and SF2. SF1: DSAHDSR: SF1 envelopes are sometimes called DSAHDSR after the 7 controls of the envelope,which are applied in the order given below.  An EG can control a variet of parameters,but to help understand, you can imagine it controlling the volume, in which case youcan substitute “volume” for “EG” below.       Parameter   Suffix   Description         Delay time (s)   _delay   time to wait after key is depressed until the EG starts       Start level (%)   _start   level at which to start       Attack time (s)   _attack   time from note start (at start level) to 100% level       Hold time (s)   _hold   time the volume is held at 100% level       Decay time* (s)   _decay   time* for the volume to decrease from 100% to the sustain level       Sustain level (%)   _sustain   the % level at which the EG remains while the key is down or the sustain pedal is down       Release time*   _release   time* for the EG to decrease to zero. This begins when both key and sustain pedal are released, even if the prior stages have not completed.    We’ll get to the asterisks in a moment.  Here is a screenshot of an audio file created using Sforzando,showing the ampeg_envelope shape and its stages.  Note that this image assumes the Start level is 0. If it were nonzero, the tip of the left-pointing arrow would look chopped off vertically.  https://media. discordapp. net/attachments/573505647841116161/720408000828932196/EnvelopeGraphic. pngHere’s a play-by-play explanation, when using the EG for volume (ampeg_xxx). When the key is depressed, Delay time elapses and then the note starts (at Start level, which above isthe default of 0. )The volume increases (at a constant dB/sec rate) for the Attack time and then reaches the peak levelfor that note (which is controlled by the velocity and possibly other parameters. )The volume stays at that level for the Hold time, after which it falls off for the Decay timeuntil it reaches the Sustain level.  It remains at that level until the key and sustain pedalare both released, when it takes the Release time to fall off to silence. Now the asterisks.  Decay time is actually a constant decay rate that is specified as the time for the EG to go from 100% to 0%.  However, this can be changed by setting xxx_decay_zero=0 to instead mean to decay from 100% to sustain level in the given time, from the actual sustain level.  Release time is actually a constant decay rate that is specified as the time for the EG to go from the sustain level to zero.  However, this can be changed setting by xxx_release_zero=1 to instead mean to decay from 100% to zero in the given time.  When using an amp enevlope generator, “0%” means “silence” but it’s actually interpreted as -90dBFS for Aria, or -80dBFS for original sfz.  This adjustment is needed because volume is contolled in dB, and silence in dB is negative infinity, which complicates the math.  Yeah, it’s confusing. Note that when using an envelope generator to control volume, it is usually not necessary to adjust release or decay times based on velocity: that will happen naturally.  That is, if I configure ampeg_release=1 and play a very loud note, that note will decay with a rate so that one second later it will be about 90 dB quieter than when it started.  If I play a very soft note, that note will also decay with the same rate, so that 1 second later it will be 90 dB quieter when it started.  That’s pretty close to how most natural instruments behave. Another note when using an envelope to control volume: if you’re playing a sample that already has a natural envelope, such as the pluck of a harp string, you normally don’t have to configure the envelope because it’s already in the sample, which has a natural attack and decay.  However, you’ll still probably want to configure a release, so that if the key is released before the sample is finished, it doesn’t end abruptly.  With most natural instruments, this release rate varies with pitch, but not velocity. SF2: The SF2 standard has a more flexible generator that can be used in addition tothe above.  This is briefly described in SF2 Modulations:Envelopes. "

For example, the flute is by nature a monophonic instrument, so if a flute wererecorded with one microphone and had one set of samples, it would make sense toset all its samples to have one group. A guitar is polyphonic, but each stringis monophonic, so a six-string guitar would naturally be split into six groups -one per string. In these cases, the group number will be equal to the off_bynumber. This is also commonly used with hi-hats - this is an example of where things canget more sophisticated with a large number of groups involved, as it’s possibleto set more closed hi-hat sounds mute more open ones, but not vice-versa, and it’salso quite possible that there are separate close mic, overhead and room samples. group and off_by can also be used in other contexts where one soundshould cause another to stop but enforcing monophony is not the goal - for example,a crash cymbal doesn’t need to be monophonic, as allowing the sound to build upis reasonably natural, but if we wanted to implement a cymbal choke, then thecrash sounds would be in one group, the choke samples in another.

This results in randomization,but prevents the possibility of the same sample being triggered twice in a rowwhen the random number generated falls into the same range as the previouslygenerated number. This can be good when there are a lot (6 or more) round robinsamples available. The code for 8 samples split into two sequential subsets mightlook like this: &lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl1_rr5. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl1_rr6. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr7. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr8. wavIn the ARIA implementation of SFZ, sequence position is not tracked together forall regions, which means the above is not a practical way to implement alternatingleft/right hand or up/down bowing samples. Also in ARIA, a separate random number is generated for each region which is playing,which means lorand/hirand probably should not be used with samples which havemultiple mic positions. Using it can result in triggering spot, overhead and roommics which do not match, and that can result in phasing issues etc. There are other potential uses which have nothing to do with round robins, forexample having key fingering noises on a clarinet trigger sometimes(but not always) when a note is played.

Though dynamic layers can also be controlled by CC, especially for sustainedinstruments, lovel and hivel are the standard way of controlling dynamics forinstruments such as drums and pianos. It is also possible to use lovel / hivelto control other things instead, such as articulations - for example, a guitarcould have palm-muted samples on low velocities, and pinch harmonics on velocity 127. These opcodes will often need to be used with amp_velcurve_N,unless amp_veltrack is set to 0. The reason for this isthat with default velocity tracking behavior and non-normalized samples (andthere are many reasons why normalizing samples should be avoided), the quietvelocity layers will be too quiet. Example: lovel=64 hivel=95An instrument with four velocity-controlled dynamic layers might use lovel andhivel like this: &lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavThe way this would work is the kick_vl1. wav region will play at velocities upto 31, with volume going gradually from 0 at velocity 0 (so, no sound) to fullvolume at velocity 31. The kick_vl2. wav region will play at velocties 32 to 63,with volume being full at velocity 63 and lower volume (but not zero) at 32. The kick_vl3 wav region will play at velocites 64 to 95, with full volume atvelocity 95.

    "body": "Welcome to SFZFormat. com!:  This is the main reference point for anyone who wants to create virtual musicalinstruments using the SFZ format. Currently the SFZ 2 opcodes and ARIA extensionsdocumented though some require more detail, and SFZ 2 opcodes not supported byARIA still need to be added. There’s enough information to make complex SFZinstruments already, but we’ll continue to add more.  To make use of the SFZ format requires three things:    Samples  SFZ player  SFZ file  which tells the player how to use the samples. The SFZ file itself can be createdusing any text editor, though for more complex cases with hundreds or thousandsof samples, additional tools can make this easier - some people use spreadsheets,and there are also dedicated SFZ creation tools.  The SFZ format is a file format to define how a collection of samples arearranged for performance. The goal behind the SFZ format is to provide a free,simple, minimalistic and expandable format to arrange, distribute and use audiosamples with the highest possible quality and the highest possible performanceflexibility. Soundware, software and hardware developers can create, use anddistribute the SFZ format files for free, for either free or commercial applications.    Here’s a basic SFZ file you can copy to start your own  Here is the list of SFZ headers  The list of SFZ 1 can be found here.   You can browse the many SFZ 2 opcodes starting here.   A few opcodes have been added to ARIA / Sforzando for more flexibility What SFZ is not: To clarify, the term SFZ as used on this site does not mean a sforzando dynamic marking,and it also is not the same thing as a soundfont. Soundfonts are a completely differentfile format which includes both the samples and the definitions of sample behavior in thesame binary file, while SFZ is a file format which only defines the behavior of musicalinstruments and does not include the sample content. SF2 may look a bit like SFZ visually,but that’s a coincidence. Making Instruments:  Text guides on how to make a simple instrument, covering the essential opcodes       Drum basics - covers global, group andregion headers, sample, key, lovel / hivel, amp_velcurve_N,seq_length, seq_position and lorand / hirand.        Sustained note basics - using a fluteas an example. Adds lokey / hikey, pitch_keycenter, xfin / xfout, locc / hicc,keyswitching, group, off_by and off_mode.     Some more advanced topics       Vibrato - typical string vibrato, humanized vibrato,asymmetrical vibrato, and even filter wobble.        Legato - simulated legato and portamento as well astrue sampled legato.        Cymbal muting - using group, off_by, off_modeand polyphony to make hi-hat and cymbal notes mute previous notesin a musically useful way.        Brush stirs - two different approaches to brushed drum techniques which produce a continuous sound rather than a hit.    "

    "body": "Because of this, it is a very useful and convenient opcode for instruments whichdo not need to spread a sample across multiple notes. That means most chromatically sampled instruments or drum kits. key values can be specified in MIDI note numbers (0-127) or note names(IPN Standard). Numbers generally are better to use for getting the SFZ tobehave the same in all DAWs. Example: These two conventions will yield the same key mapping: key=72orkey=c5Both are also equivalent to: lokey=72 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=72Key can also be combined with the others, which will override the value set by keyalthough key should be specified first. In ARIA, the value set by pitch_keycenterwill always be used, whether key or pitch_keycenter is set first in the SFZ file. However, in some other players, setting pitch_keycenter to a different value than keyis only effective if key is set first and pitch_keycenter second. Therefore, forcompatibility, it is best to set key first, and pitch_keycenter later. key=72 lokey=70Will be equivalent to lokey=70 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=72However, this would just be the same as setting key=72, as key comes later andthe lokey value it would set will override the previous lokey. lokey=70 key=72"

In many cases, though, it makes sense to treat the legato notesdifferently than the notes which start a phrase when no other note is playing. Thetrigger opcode is used to separate regions into initial and legato. Forsustained sounds, it can make sense to use the offset opcode to skip the startof the sample for legato regions. It’s also probably a good idea to use offset_attackin these cases, which both makes the transition sound smoother and avoids clicks andpops in cases where the offset does not fall on a zero crossing. Here are the relevantopcodes from the Hadziha choir. An offset of 6000 samples is enough to skip the fraction of a second when the singersare starting the note, but not enough to skip the part of the sample when they’re stillsettling on a common pitch, so it works well for this particular choir. The crossfadetimes with an off time of 1 second and legato note attack time of 0. 4 seconds areprobably much longer than would be needed for most solo instruments or voices, orensembles intended for fast legato, but could be a good range for other types ofensembles playing slowly. Note that the samples are not all in the same group - the initial note regions are inpolyphony group 1, which is muted by group 2. The legato regions are in polyphonygroup 2, which mutes itself. Having everything in group 1 should also work, though. This was done this was to allow the use of additional syllable start samples, whichwould then be group 3 and also be muted by group 2. As with hi-hat muting, if thereare multiple mic positions in separate files, each mic position will need its ownpolyphony groups. &lt;global&gt;off_mode=timeoff_time=1amp_veltrack=0&lt;master&gt;trigger=firstgroup=1off_by=2//Sample map goes here#include  mappings/6_a_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;trigger=legatooffset=6000ampeg_attack=0. 4group=2off_by=2//Sample map goes here#include  mappings/6_a_map. sfz As this does not use velocity to control note volume, that frees up velocity forsomething else, so in this specific case velocity is repurposed to shorten theattack time on the legato notes, which makes the patch more intuitively playable. &lt;global&gt;off_mode=timeoff_time=1amp_veltrack=0&lt;master&gt;trigger=firstgroup=1off_by=3//Sample map goes here#include  mappings/6_a_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;trigger=legatooffset=6000ampeg_attack=1ampeg_vel2attack=-0. 8group=3off_by=3//Sample map goes here#include  mappings/6_a_map. sfz Portamento: Another possibility is portamento, or having a pitch glide implemented on thelegato regions. Here are the relevant opcodes from Karoryfer SamplesMeatbass, which has both legato and portamento. The portamento isvery obviously fake for slow glides across long intervals, but as long as theinterval is no more than a third or fourth, it can be convincing. Of course, thenarrower the interval and the shorter the time, the easier it is to soundconvincing. With the portamento time at zero, this is effectively the same asnon-portamento legato in the above example. In the below setup, MIDI CC109 controls the glide time and an SFZ2 envelopeis used to make the pitch change happen. CC140 is the ARIA extension CC for pitchdelta, and being the difference in pitch between the previous note and thecurrent note, it sets the depth of the glide envelope. &lt;global&gt;eg06_sustain=1 //Pitch envelope setup for legato slideseg06_level0=-1 //Envelope starts away from the note pitcheg06_time0=0eg06_pitch_oncc140=100 //This is the pitch deptheg06_time1=0eg06_level1=0 //At the end of the envelope, return to base pitch//eg06_time1_oncc109 needs to be set for the legato regions - but we don't want//it on for all regions so the default is 0//At zero envelope duration the pitch goes to base pitch immediately so there//is no glide//Typical stuff for monophonic instrumentsoff_mode=normalampeg_release_oncc104=2All the sample regions are then basically duplicated in non-legato and legatoversions. Here’s an example non-legato region with triggerset to first and no eg06_time_oncc109 set. The group and off_by work just likein the above examples. &lt;group&gt;trigger=firstoff_mode=normalgroup=1off_by=1&lt;region&gt;sample=. . \Samples\arco_looped\c4_sustain. wavpitch_keycenter=48And the corresponding legato region with trigger set to legato, the eg06 glideenvelope time control, and also an attack time, to let the note fade inmore gradually, with this controlled by CC100 rather than velocity, as theexample above. This is another option. &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatooff_mode=normalgroup=1off_by=1eg06_time1_oncc109=0. 3ampeg_attack_oncc100=0. 5&lt;region&gt;sample=. . \Samples\arco_looped\c4_sustain. wavpitch_keycenter=48True sampled legato: Here are examples from a simple flute test by MatFluor. The trigger=first regionswork similarly as all the above examples, and the sw_previous opcode can be usedto choose which sample plays for the legato regions. If the samples would includeboth the legato transition and the complete sustain of the following note, thingswould be very simple: &lt;group&gt;// Legato transitions and the complete sustain of the next note both in the same sampletrigger=legatogroup=2off_by=1ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_release=0. 2off_mode=normal// Leg transitions up&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_g4_a4. wav key=A4 sw_previous=G4&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_g4_c5. wav key=C5 sw_previous=G4&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_a4_c5. wav key=C5 sw_previous=A4// Leg transitions down&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_c5_a4. wav key=A4 sw_previous=C5&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_c5_g4. wav key=G4 sw_previous=C5Recording the full sustain after every transition adds greatly to the recordingtime, diskspace and RAM use, however.

Practical applications include using MIDI CC to switch things on and off - forexample, additional voices, release noises, vibrato etc. A common example wouldbe having a hi-hat with various degrees of openness sampled, all of those mappedto the same MIDI note, and hicc/locc used to define the ranges for which eachdegree of openness should play. A simpler example would be switching betweensine, saw and noise waveforms: &lt;region&gt;hicc=63 sample=*sine&lt;region&gt;locc=64 hicc=126 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;locc=127 sample=*noiseThis is a “hard” switch - if a region is within the locc to hicc range it plays,if it’s outside that range it does not play. For smooth fades controlled by CC(such as crossfaded dynamic layers or crossfaded vibrato layers on sustainedinstruments), other opcodes such as xfin_loccN / xfin_hiccNand xfout_loccN / xfout_hiccN should be used, or perhapsthe amplitude_onccN ARIA extension.

The possible values are:  no_loop: no looping will be performed. Sample will play straight from start       to end, or until note off, whatever reaches first.  one_shot: sample will play from start to end, ignoring note off.        This is commonly used for drums.        This mode is engaged automatically if the count opcode       is defined.  loop_continuous: once the player reaches sample loop point,           the loop will play until note expiration. This includes looping during the release phase.  loop_sustain: the player will play the loop while the note is held, by keeping         it depressed or by using the sustain pedal (CC64). During the release phase, there’s no looping. Whether no_loop, loop_continuous or loop_sustain is set, the duration of the release phase is set usingampeg_release. However, in loop_sustain or no_loop mode, the sound can be cut offbefore the release phase ends, if the end of sample is reached. In loop_continuous mode, the loop willrepeat if the loop end is reached during the release phase. For samples with trigger=release set, no_loop and one_shot will both behave as one_shotand the entire release sample will play. If loop_continuous is set, looping will beapplied - and unless loop_count is set or there is some other way the sound will be muted,that means the sound can potentially continue indefinitely. If an instrument is using the default loop_mode=no_loop, there is no need to set loop_mode=one_shot for therelease samples; however, if an instrument has loop_mode=loop_continuous set under a header which alsoincludes release samples, the release regions will normally need to be set to loop_mode=one_shot to override that.

The possible values are:  no_loop: no looping will be performed. Sample will play straight from start       to end, or until note off, whatever reaches first.  one_shot: sample will play from start to end, ignoring note off.        This is commonly used for drums.        This mode is engaged automatically if the count opcode       is defined.  loop_continuous: once the player reaches sample loop point,           the loop will play until note expiration. This includes looping during the release phase.  loop_sustain: the player will play the loop while the note is held, by keeping         it depressed or by using the sustain pedal (CC64). During the release phase, there’s no looping. Whether no_loop, loop_continuous or loop_sustain is set, the duration of the release phase is set usingampeg_release. However, in loop_sustain or no_loop mode, the sound can be cut offbefore the release phase ends, if the end of sample is reached. In loop_continuous mode, the loop willrepeat if the loop end is reached during the release phase. For samples with trigger=release set, no_loop and one_shot will both behave as one_shotand the entire release sample will play. If loop_continuous is set, looping will beapplied - and unless loop_count is set or there is some other way the sound will be muted,that means the sound can potentially continue indefinitely. If an instrument is using the default loop_mode=no_loop, there is no need to set loop_mode=one_shot for therelease samples; however, if an instrument has loop_mode=loop_continuous set under a header which alsoincludes release samples, the release regions will normally need to be set to loop_mode=one_shot to override that.

This results in randomization,but prevents the possibility of the same sample being triggered twice in a rowwhen the random number generated falls into the same range as the previouslygenerated number. This can be good when there are a lot (6 or more) round robinsamples available. The code for 8 samples split into two sequential subsets mightlook like this: &lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl1_rr5. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl1_rr6. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr7. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr8. wavIn the ARIA implementation of SFZ, sequence position is not tracked together forall regions, which means the above is not a practical way to implement alternatingleft/right hand or up/down bowing samples. Also in ARIA, a separate random number is generated for each region which is playing,which means lorand/hirand probably should not be used with samples which havemultiple mic positions. Using it can result in triggering spot, overhead and roommics which do not match, and that can result in phasing issues etc. There are other potential uses which have nothing to do with round robins, forexample having key fingering noises on a clarinet trigger sometimes(but not always) when a note is played.

Though dynamic layers can also be controlled by CC, especially for sustainedinstruments, lovel and hivel are the standard way of controlling dynamics forinstruments such as drums and pianos. It is also possible to use lovel / hivelto control other things instead, such as articulations - for example, a guitarcould have palm-muted samples on low velocities, and pinch harmonics on velocity 127. These opcodes will often need to be used with amp_velcurve_N,unless amp_veltrack is set to 0. The reason for this isthat with default velocity tracking behavior and non-normalized samples (andthere are many reasons why normalizing samples should be avoided), the quietvelocity layers will be too quiet. Velocity 0 is a note-off message, so 1 is the lowest usable value with hivel/lovel. Example: lovel=64 hivel=95An instrument with four velocity-controlled dynamic layers might use lovel andhivel like this: &lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavThe way this would work is the kick_vl1. wav region will play at velocities upto 31, with volume going gradually from 0 at velocity 0 (so, no sound) to fullvolume at velocity 31. The kick_vl2. wav region will play at velocties 32 to 63,with volume being full at velocity 63 and lower volume (but not zero) at 32. The kick_vl3 wav region will play at velocites 64 to 95, with full volume atvelocity 95. Finally, the kick_vl4 layer plays at velocities 96 to 127, with noamp_velcurve_N set meaning it will have full volume at velocity 127. "

This is because once a note is played, its MIDI note number andnote on velocity remain the same for that note. MIDI CC, however, is sharedacross the entire instrument, and this means another note on or note off eventwill change CC 131, 132 and 133. This can give unexpected results when usingthese CCs to adjust keytracking or velocity tracking of various parameters,especially in polyphonic instruments with long-sustaining sounds. Note gate is an on/off - it’s 0 when no MIDI notes are pressed, and 1 whenat least one note is currently pressed. Unipolar random is from 0 to 1. Bipolar random is from -1 to 1. Alternate changes between 0 and 1 every timea note on message is received. Some of the parameters, such as aftertouch and note off velocity, are rarelysupported by modern MIDI hardware controllers, though they are part of the MIDIspecification and can be edited in DAWs. Many MIDI keyboards will send adefault note off velocity, such as 64, with every note off event regardless ofhow fast the key was actually moving at the time.

Cases using both pitch_keycenter and key are described inmore detail under key. sample as value: Starting with SFZ v2, it’s possible to set pitch_keycenter to sample(pitch_keycenter=sample). This causes the SFZ player to look in the sample filemetadata for the keycenter value. If pitch_keycenter is set to sample and thefile metadata does not contain pitch information, it defaults to MIDI note 0. If samples contain good quality metadata, setting pitch_keycenter to samplecan be simpler than setting the keycenter for each individual sample.

Thebelow examples all use the group opcode, not the group header, butthat is not the only way to use the polyphony opcode. In addition to positive integer values, polyphony can also be set toone of three special text values. With all of these, the polyphony limitis set to 1, and the following behavior is also triggered:  legato_high: the highest note played sounds and lower notes are muted.  legato_last: the most recent note played sounds (typical legato behavior).  legato_low: the lowest note played sounds. Examples: polyphony=12polyphony=5polyphony=legato_lowAn example limiting a crash cymbal to four polyphony voices. group=1polyphony=4&lt;region&gt; key=49 sample=crash. wavHere is a ride limited to a total of seven voices, with both bow and bellarticulations sharing the same polyphony group and the same seven-voicelimit. group=2polyphony=7&lt;region&gt; key=51 sample=ride_bow. wav&lt;region&gt; key=53 sample=ride_bell. wavThis opcode is useful for controlling sound buildup, limiting resource use,and for emulating the behavior of vintage keyboards with limited polyphony. It’s also possible to use note_polyphony instead when all thesounds we want to mute each other are mapped to the same pitch, or use both incombination. An alternative for controlling sound buildup is usingampeg_release with off_mode set to normal. It’s also possible to have a group with limited polyphony which can be muted byanother group, such as a cymbal with edge chokes. &lt;group&gt;group=2off_by=3polyphony=7&lt;region&gt; key=51 sample=ride_bow. wav&lt;region&gt; key=53 sample=ride_bell. wav&lt;group&gt;group=3&lt;region&gt; key=54 sample=ride. choke. wavAn alternative is note_polyphony. The difference betweenapplying polyphony across one note and using note_polyphony is that note_polyphony also usesnote_selfmask which opens up some additionaloptions. With the default setting, lower-velocity notes do not mute higher-velocityones. This is useful for long-ringing instruments such as piano with the sustain pedalpressed down or hammered dulcimer. It can also be useful for cymbals, althoughespecially with hi-hats, those will often use different notes for differentarticulations, and note_polyphony would be limited to working within anarticulation.

    "body": "ARIA adds also the polyphony_group alias to reduce the confusion betweenthe group opcode and the ‹group› header. Examples: group=3group=334The group opcode is used together with off_by to makesomething monophonic. For example, the flute is by nature a monophonic instrument, so if a flute wererecorded with one microphone and had one set of samples, it would make sense toset all its samples to have one group. A guitar is polyphonic, but each stringis monophonic, so a six-string guitar would naturally be split into six groups -one per string. In these cases, the group number will be equal to the off_bynumber. This is also commonly used with hi-hats - this is an example of where things canget more sophisticated with a large number of groups involved, as it’s possibleto set more closed hi-hat sounds mute more open ones, but not vice-versa, and it’salso quite possible that there are separate close mic, overhead and room samples. group and off_by can also be used in other contexts where one soundshould cause another to stop but enforcing monophony is not the goal - for example,a crash cymbal doesn’t need to be monophonic, as allowing the sound to build upis reasonably natural, but if we wanted to implement a cymbal choke, then thecrash sounds would be in one group, the choke samples in another.

A regionis defined between two &lt;region&gt; headers, or between a &lt;region&gt; header and a&lt;group&gt; header, or between a &lt;region&gt; header and the end of the file. Following the &lt;region&gt; header one or more opcodes can be defined. The opcodes arespecial keywords which instruct the player on what, when and how to play a sample. Opcodes within a region can appear in any order, and they have to be separatedby one or more spaces or tabulation controls. Opcodes can appear in separatedlines within a region. Opcodes and assigned opcode values are separated by the equal to sign (=),without spaces between the opcode and the sign. For instance: sample=trombone_a4_ff. wavsample=cello_a5_pp_first_take. wavare valid examples, while: sample = cello_a4_pp. wavIs not (note the spaces at the sides of the = sign). Input Controls andPerformance Parameters opcodes are optional, so they might not be present in thedefinition file. An ‘expectable’ default value for each parameter is pre-defined,and will be used if there’s no definition. Example region definitions: &lt;region&gt; sample=440. wavThis region definition instructs the player to play the sample file ‘440. wav’for the whole keyboard range. &lt;region&gt; lokey=64 hikey=67 sample=440. wavThis region features a very basic set of input parameters (lokey and hikey, whichrepresent the low and high MIDI notes in the keyboard), and the sample definition. This instructs the player to play the sample ‘440. wav’,if a key in the 64-67 range is played. It is very important to note that all Input Controls defined in a region actusing the AND boolean operator. Consequently, all conditions must be matched forthe region to play. For instance: &lt;region&gt; lokey=64 hikey=67 lovel=0 hivel=34 locc1=0 hicc1=40 sample=440. wavThis region definition instructs the player to play the sample ‘440. wav’ ifthere is an incoming note event in the 64-67 range AND the note has a velocityin the 0~34 range AND last modulation wheel (cc1) message was in the 0-40 range.

Some players also match velocity ranges for each step in the sequence, whichcan cause problems when the sequence steps do not have the same velocitylayer split points.

    "body": "The set of modulations available under the SFZ1 specification is fixed, andthere’s a dedicated opcode for every possible modulation, including fairlyesoteric ones such as using note velocity to modulate the hold stage of thepitch envelope. Basic MIDI CC modulation: A few opcodes can be modulated simply by MIDI CC, with the modulation addingto what the opcode would normally do. These are: offset anddelay. For example, this would have a sample offset of 500 when the modulating CC isat 0, and a sample offset of 1000 when the modulating CC is at max: offset=500offset_cc100=500It’s also possible to just specify the modulation, in which case thedefault value is what will be modulated. The defaults for offset, delay andEQ band gain are 0, so this would result in the offset being modulated between0 and 1000: offset_cc100=1000Modulating default values: The three EQ bands’ frequency, bandwidth andgain work similarly, but also add velocity tracking. The EQbandwidth and center frequency also have non-zero defaults,for example eq2_freq is 500 if not specified. So, this would modulate the centerfrequency of the second EQ band between 500 and 1500 if eq2_freq is left at default: eq2_freqcc110=1000Velocity tracking, keytracking and randomization: EQ frequency and gain (but notbandwidth) can additionally be modulated by velocity. For example, if we want tomake a sound brighter when the velocity is higher, we might use something like this: eq1_vel2gain=-6eq2_vel2gain=12eq2_vel2freq=500The xfin/xfout CCs are also away to fade sounds in and out using MIDI CC. An example of one note with twodynamic layers being crossfaded: &lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127In addition to MIDI CC, crossfades can also use MIDI note number and velocity asmodulation sources, and the xf_cccurve, xf_keycurveand xf_velcurve give the choice of two curves for each of these modulations. More sophisticated modulations are possible with volume,pitch and filter cutoff. Volume and cutoff can be modulated by MIDI CC directly(pitch can’t in SFZ1 - the tune_ccN modulation is an ARIA extension). All threecan also have randomization applied and be modulated by MIDI note number andvelocity. The nomenclature for volume is a little confusing, with gain_ccN using“gain” in the name, while the others are called amp_random,amp_keytrack and amp_veltrack. gain_cc80=-6amp_random=3amp_keytrack=-1. 3amp_veltrack=80LFOs and envelopes: Volume, filter and cutoff also each get an LFO and anenvelope. The LFO rate anddepth can be modulated by MIDI CC. Each LFO also has a simple envelope withdelay and fade, but modulating the duration of these is not allowed under theSFZ1 spec (though it is with SFZ2 LFOs). Here’s a typical pitch vibrato LFO: pitchlfo_freq=2pitchlfo_freqcc50=10pitchlfo_depthcc51=33Each envelope parameter can also be modulated by CC, or by velocity. Here’s aexmple setup for a synth-style ADSR volume envelope (hold is not specified so thedefault hold value of 0 is used) controlled by CCs and some initialminimum values set for attack and release, along with a default sustain of 0: ampeg_attack=0. 001ampeg_attack_oncc40=1ampeg_decay_oncc41=4ampeg_sustain=1ampeg_sustain_oncc42=100ampeg_release=0. 1ampeg_release_oncc43=0. 9Modulating envelope parameters with velocity allows, for example, setting up a filteron an acid bass which will sweep farther with higher velocity, and also sweep faster. cutoff=120resonance=12fileg_attack=0. 5fileg_decay=1fileg_depth=500fileg_vel2attack=-0. 4fileg_vel2decay=-0. 8fileg_vel2depth=4000If something is not described above, then modulating it is not possible under theSFZ1 specification, and will require using SFZ2or possibly some extension opcodes.

All SFZ1 modulations are stillavailable under the SFZ2 spec, and will often be easier to use in cases such asenvelopes where the standard AHDSR shape is all that’s needed. The basic difference is that SFZ1 has three envelopes - one assigned tovolume, one to pitch, and one to filter cutoff. There are also three LFOs,one for each of those modulation targets. SFZ2 can have an arbitraty numberof envelopes and LFOs, with the ability to specify one or more modulationtargets from a list. It is even possible for LFOs to modulate other LFOsand envelopes to modulate LFOs (but not for LFOs to modulate envelopes). In addition, SFZ2 envelopes can have an arbitrary number of points. Additional MIDI CC modulation: SFZ2 adds one more paramter which can be modulated with MIDI CC - stereo width. Also need to document pan_onccX and find out whether it’s SFZ1 or SFZ2 - currentlynot sure, needs testing. LFOs: For each LFO, an LFO number must be specified - lfo01, lfo02 etc. EachLFO has the following parameters:  lfoN_wave lfoN_freq lfoN_freq_onccX lfoN_freq_smoothccX lfoN_freq_stepccX lfoN_delay lfoN_delay_onccX lfoN_fade lfoN_fade_onccX lfoN_phase lfoN_phase_onccX lfoN_countClick on each link for a detailed description. Similarly to SFZ1 LFOs,there’s a frequency, a delay and a fade-in time. In addition, thewaveform shape and initial phase can be specified and the LFO canbe configured to run for a limited number of counts. The frequency, delay, fade and initial phase can all be modulated byMIDI CC. There is no modulation for LFO depth - to control the depthof vibrato etc, use MIDI CC to modulate how much the LFO affects thedesired target.

For example lfo01_pitch=100makes LFO 01 affect pitch with a max depth of 100 cents. lfo03_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1. 3would make LFO 03 add up to 1. 3 Hertz tothe frequency of LFO 01, with the amount modulated by MIDI CC 117.

The opcodes usedto create these envelopes are:  egN_points egN_levelX egN_levelX_onccY egN_timeX egN_timeX_onccY egN_shapeX egN_curveX egN_sustain egN_loopEnvelope targets: Similarly to LFOs, envelopes have assignable modulation targets. Thesedestinations are added as a suffix to ‘egN_’ - so, for example: eg01_pitch=2400would have envelope 01 modulate pitch, with an envelope depth of 2400 cents. These are the available targets related to amplitude and stereo positioning:  amplitude amplitude_oncc volume volume_oncc pan pan_oncc width width_onccTargets for pitch:  pitch pitch_onccTargets for filters:  cutoff cutoff_oncc resonance resonance_oncc cutoff2 cutoff2_oncc resonance2 resonance2_onccTargets for EQ bands:  eqNbw eqNbw_oncc eqNfreq eqNfreq_oncc eqNgain eqNgain_onccTargets for modulating LFOs:  depth_lfo depthadd_lfo freq_lfoThese two need to be tested - are they for envelopes to modulate other envelopes?  depth depth_onccTargets for modulating decim and bitred do not appear to have been included in the specification. Example envelope: Here is a simple pitch envelope which will start a note with a glide from up to an octavelower, with the depth and time modulated by MIDI CCs. The envelope will statt at a lowervalue at envelope point 0, and return the pitch to normal at envelope point 1. eg01_sustain=1 //Pitch envelope setup for slideseg01_level0=1eg01_level1=0eg01_time0=0eg01_time1=0eg01_pitch_oncc100=-1200eg01_time1_oncc101=1Using LFOs and evelopes togehter: Here is an example of using both an envelope and an LFO to modulate pitch, with commondepth and delay parameters. The goal here is asymmetrical pitch vibrato - vibrato whichdoes not go up and down around the original pitch, but instead only goes below it. Thisis idiomatic with saxophones, and is also how vibrato with certain types of non-floatingguitar bridges works (string-bending vibrato is similar, of course, but in the otherdirection). Shifting the phase of LFO01 will make the vibrato waveform start at the top. We also needto lower the pitch by the same amount as the vibrato depth. Using an envelope for thisallows us to delay the onset of the vibrato (again, an important element of idiomaticsaxophone vibrato) without a discontinuous jump in pitch. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Saxy vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_phase=0. 25 //To make it start at the toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1eg01_pitch_oncc111=20eg01_sustain=1eg01_level0=0eg01_level1=0eg01_level2=-1eg01_time0=0eg01_time1=0eg01_time1_oncc116=1eg01_time2=0Using SFZ1 and SFZ2 modulations together: Both SFZ1 and SFZ2 modulations may be mixed freely. Indeed, it may be simpler to accomplishthe above using the SFZ1 pitch envelope, as it is sufficient in this case, with the SFZ2LFO. Setting the initial phase and modulating the delay with MIDI CC would not be possiblewith the SFZ1 pitch LFO. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Saxy vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_phase=0. 25 //To make it start at the toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20SmoothccN and stepccN: Most MIDI CC modulations, though not all, can have use smoothccN and stepccN. These work similarly to bend_smooth and bend_step. SmoothccN adds “inertia” to a modulation, so quickly changing the MIDI CC value has a slower effecton the modulation target than it would normally. StepccN causes the modulation to happen in adiscrete number of steps. Setting the number of steps to 1 would make the modulation anall-or-nothing control. This is what’s possible under the SFZ2 specification. There are some additional modulationsavailable as ARIA extensions, with amplitude_onccNbeing a very useful one. "

While SFZv2 does not limit the targets for smoothing in the spec, currently ARIA only implements smoothing for pitch-related and volume-related (including amplitude, pan and position) modulation targets. Examples: &lt;region&gt;sample=*sinepitch_oncc27=1200pitch_smoothcc27=100Notes: Increasing the smoothing past 100 ms allows the SFZ instrument creator to create a noticeable lag in the control response, which is useful when modeling guitar feedback, for example. Default value is 0ms (no smoothing). However be aware some DAWs smooth the drawn CC automation before it reaches the SFZ player, which means some smoothing will occur regardless of what smoothcc is set to, and any smoothcc smoothing will be applied to those already smoothed control values.

    "body": "Introduction: This tutorial describes implementing typical subtractive synthesizermodulations - filters, envelopes and LFOs - in SFZ. It uses theCaveman Cosmonaut instrument by Karoryfer Samples as an example. Thisdoes not cover all modulations used in classic hardware subtractivesynths, but it’s a start. Basic amplifier envelope: Though subtractive synths get their name from having frequenciessubtracted from the sound by filter, the volume envelope is probablythe most fundamental modulation. Here is an AHDSR envelope includingcontrol parameter labels and defaults. &lt;control&gt;label_cc100=Attack timelabel_cc101=Hold timelabel_cc102=Decay timelabel_cc103=Sustain levellabel_cc104=Release timeset_cc102=63set_cc103=51set_cc104=31&lt;global&gt;//AHDSRampeg_attack=0. 002ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_release=0. 002ampeg_attack_oncc100=0. 5ampeg_hold_oncc101=1ampeg_decay_oncc102=5ampeg_sustain_oncc103=100ampeg_release_oncc104=2An ADSR envelope would simple leave out the hold stage control,leaving the default hold time of zero. Further envelope possibilities: The above envelope will affect all sounds, as it’s set at the globallevel. In many classic synths, it’s possible to have separateenvelopes modulating the volume of different oscillators, forexample using a shorter envelope to turn a noise oscillator intoa short transient. If more envelope stages are required, an SFZ2 envelope with anarbitrary amount of points can be used to modulate amplitudeinstead of the SFZ1 envelope above. In the ARIA SFZ player, amplifier envelope durations are calculatedonce on trigger, which means changing envelope parameters other thansustain and release while a note is playing will not change the sound. The ampeg_dynamic opcode could be set to 1 in order to recalculateenvelope parameters every time one of the control parameters receivesa MIDI message, which could be closer to the behavior of mostanalog synthesizer hardware. Caveman Cosmonaut has a more unusual parameter called Env Soften,which has no effect on some oscillators which have morehigh-frequency content, and adds to the release and decay timesof the warmer-sounding oscillators. This is highly unusual, butcan be musically useful for things such as plucks, as the warmersounds linger longer. This is similar to the effect of releaseor decay on a lowpass filter cutoff, but perhaps a little moreorganic. That’s set per oscillator, rather than globally, likethis, with CC 18 selecting the oscillator, and CC 106 being theenvelope soften: &lt;master&gt;locc18=11hicc18=20ampeg_decay_oncc106=1. 25ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 7#include  mappings/unitra_flutes. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=21hicc18=30ampeg_decay_oncc106=1ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 4#include  mappings/unitra_clarinet. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=31hicc18=40ampeg_decay_oncc106=1. 5ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 6#include  mappings/unitra_trombone. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=41hicc18=50ampeg_decay_oncc106=0. 5ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 2#include  mappings/unitra_trompette. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=51hicc18=60ampeg_decay_oncc106=1. 25ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 5#include  mappings/unitra_violin. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=61hicc18=70#include  mappings/unitra_tremolo. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=71#include  mappings/unitra_all. sfz Basic filter: The filter in the example instrument is a single lowpass filterwith cutoff and resonance controls,adjustable velocity tracking using vara two-stage filter cutoff envelope. &lt;control&gt;label_cc120=Filter cutofflabel_cc121=Resonancelabel_cc124=Veltracklabel_cc125=Plucklabel_cc126=Filter attacklabel_cc127=Filter decayset_cc120=127set_cc127=40&lt;global&gt;//Lowpass filtercutoff=250cutoff_cc120=9600fil_keytrack=100resonance=0resonance_cc121=18var01_cutoff=6000 //Velocity trackvar01_mod=multvar01_oncc131=1var01_oncc124=1cutoff_cc124=-3000//Pluck envelopefileg_depth=0fileg_depthcc125=8400fileg_sustain=0fileg_attack=0fileg_attackcc126=0. 5fileg_decay=0. 001fileg_decaycc127=2Filter keytracking: Making the filter cutoff keytrack is a simple matter ofsetting the fil_keytrack to 100; however, things getmore complicated if filter keytracking is not desired. Although fil_keytrack can be set to 0 and the basefilter cutoff will then not keytrack, the filter cutoffmodulation in SFZ is specified in cents, not Hertz. Thismeans the amount of the cutoff which is modulated willkeytrack, regardless of what fil_keytrack is set to. Thisisn’t a big issue with most synthesizers, but when tryingto make an adjustable highpass filter for all pieces ofa drum kit except the kick, for example, it can makethings complicated. Adjusting keytracking for the modulated amount requiresusing var and the extended CC 133 (MIDI key number). Var and extended CCs are already used above for thevelocity tracking on the filter cutoff. The example instrumenthas a somewhat convoluted and unusual configuration forthe filter keytracking, where when CC 120 has a veryhigh value, the cutoff will be slightly above 22. 05 kHzfor all keys in the instrument’s range, while the cutoffwhen CC 120 is at zero has 70% keytracking. This is notat all standard, and means the base cutoff has moderatepositive keytracking while the cutoff modulation hasnegative keytracking. //By default, cutoff modulation is measured in cents//To make the modulation not keytrack, we make a kludge//Using varcutoff=250var02_cutoff=9000var02_mod=multvar02_oncc120=1var02_curvecc120=0var02_oncc133=1var02_curvecc133=11fil_keytrack=70At the end of the SFZ file, the curve is then specified: &lt;curve&gt;curve_index=11v000=1v024=1v084=0. 63v127=0. 25More filter possibilities: It would be easy to have more filter envelope stages; onlyattack and decay are used above to keep things simple, asthose parameters are enough to create basic plucks (zeroattack, moderate decay) and 303 style basses (slightlylonger attack, moderate decay). Using fil2_type and cutoff2 allows two filters in series,for example a lowpass and highpass filter. Fil_type canalso be used to choose different filter types, perhaps withlocc/hicc. Modulating the filter cutoff with LFOs is added below, in thevibrato section. Vibrato: Vibrato can affect pitch, volume (for tremolo) and filter cutoff(for wobble). Here is a typical setup using one LFO to modulateall three. &lt;control&gt;label_cc111=Vibrato to pitchlabel_cc112=Vibrato speedlabel_cc113=Vibrato to cutofflabel_cc114=Vibrato to volumelabel_cc115=Vibrato delaylabel_cc116=Vibrato fadeset_cc112=40&lt;global&gt;lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=0. 1lfo01_freq_oncc112=9. 9lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500lfo01_volume_oncc114=6//Wobblelfo01_cutoff=0lfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600Humanized vibrato: Humanization is obviously not a standard feature of synthesizers. Technically, though, it’s not difficult to implement. The example instrument adds CC 117 for controlling theamount of randomizationof the vibrato LFOs. This is similar to the humanizationdescribed in the vibrato tutorial, but using CC 135 togenerate a true random number for each voice, whichmeans any unison voices’ vibrato will drift out of syncwith those belonging to other voices. This is musicallyuseful for creating more complex pads, for example. Similarprinciples could also be used to emulate analog oscillators’much more subtle pitch drift. &lt;control&gt;label_cc111=Vibrato to pitchlabel_cc112=Vibrato speedlabel_cc113=Vibrato to cutofflabel_cc114=Vibrato to volumelabel_cc115=Vibrato delaylabel_cc116=Vibrato fadelabel_cc117=Vibrato humanizeset_cc112=40&lt;global&gt;//Vibrato and humanization setuplfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=0. 1lfo01_freq_oncc112=9. 9lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500lfo01_volume_oncc114=6//Wobblelfo01_cutoff=0lfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600lfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblierlfo02_phase=0lfo02_phase_oncc135=1 //Phase randomizedlfo02_freq=0. 01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobblinesslfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=0. 5 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc112=2. 5 //Faster when the first LFO is going fasterlfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobblinesslfo03_phase=0. 4lfo03_phase_oncc135=0. 179 //Different phase response to random than the second LFOlfo03_freq=0. 5lfo03_freq_oncc117=-0. 4lfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1lfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4lfo04_wave=1 //Fourth LFO for slowly changing the oscillator mixlfo04_phase_oncc135=1lfo04_freq=0. 01lfo04_freq_oncc135=0. 25 //Randomly from almost not moving at all to still pretty slowlfo04_volume_oncc117=1. 5 //Slight volume changesUnison and detune: Unison is a simple matter of triggering multiple regionswith one MIDI note. If using a simple sound source suchas a saw oscillators, all regions will sound identical sothe only result will be additional volume. Making theunison more interesting requires some of: using differentsamples for each voice, detuning the voices, and shiftingthe phase of the voices. The example instrument uses many sets of samples from ananalog keyboard, with every key producing a slightlydifferent timbre, and transposed versions of those soundsused for unison. The detune and width amounts vary foreach of the three oscillators, but here is a simplifiedversion assuming there is only one oscillator. Note that although there is a width opcodes foruse with stereo samples, in this case the left channel and right areseparate mono samples, so pan is used to spread themin stereo - not width. As the samples here are quite long, offset_randomis applied globally to effecitvely randomize each voice’s phase. Withtrue single-cycle waveforms, the max offset would have to be set tomatch each voice’s max sample length. &lt;control&gt;label_cc25=Unisonlabel_cc26=Widthlabel_cc27=Detuneset_cc26=63set_cc27=63&lt;global&gt;//Randomizing the start points of the samples to randomize phaseoffset_random=1000//Center voice&lt;master&gt;#include  sample_map_basic. sfz //Left voice&lt;region&gt;amplitude_cc25=100amplitude_cc25=100locc25=1pan_cc26=-100tune_cc27=-33#include  sample_map_transposed_1. sfz //Right voice&lt;region&gt;amplitude_cc25=100locc25=1pan_cc26=100tune_cc27=33amplitude_cc25=100#include  sample_map_transposed_2. sfz More complex detune: Another highly unsual feature of Caveman Cosmonaut, though, isthat the detune doesn’t have to be fixed. There are additionaldetune controls which detune the additional voices more at thestart of the note, and then drift towards a common pitch overtime, using pitch envelopes. This is definitely not part ofany typical hardware analog synthesizer’s feature set, but itdoes have something in common with the way real world choirsor instrumental ensembles find a commmon pitch. &lt;control&gt;label_cc25=Unisonlabel_cc26=Widthlabel_cc27=Detunelabel_cc28=Extra detune amtlabel_cc29=Extra detune timeset_cc26=63set_cc27=63set_cc29=16&lt;global&gt;//Randomizing the start points of the samples to randomize phaseoffset_random=1000//Pitch envelope defaults for the fancy detunepitcheg_sustain=0pitcheg_decay_shape=-2//Center voice&lt;master&gt;#include  sample_map_basic. sfz //Left voice&lt;region&gt;amplitude_cc25=100locc25=1pan_cc26=-100tune_cc27=-33pitcheg_depth_oncc28=-150pitcheg_decay_oncc29=5#include  sample_map_transposed_1. sfz //Right voice&lt;region&gt;amplitude_cc25=100locc25=1pan_cc26=100tune_cc27=33pitcheg_depth_oncc28=150pitcheg_decay_oncc29=5#include  sample_map_transposed_2. sfz Waveform selection and oscillator mixing: This is just locc/hicc for selection, and amplitude for volumecontrols.

    "body": "This ARIA extension sets the minimum pointat which the sustain pedal (MIDI CC 64) is considered “down”. Default is 0. 5, meaning the sustain pedal is down as long as the CC value isanything above 0. To make the pedal only act as “down” past the halfway point,set this to 64 - then the pedal is considered “up” from CC value 0 to 63,and “down” from 64 to 127. Leaving this at the default value of 1, or setting itto some other low number such as 10, is useful when the piano supportshalf-pedaling. Setting it to 64 is preferred by some users who want to use thesustain pedal as an on/off sustain switch for instruments with no half-pedaling. Please note that the direction of the MIDI CC values is normally from 0 at thetop of the pedal to 127 when it is at the bottom, meaning that physically “down”on the pedal is up in terms of MIDI CC value. It is possible to set this to different values for different regions, so thatfor example mechanical noises and notes will not be affected by the sustain pedalin the same way.

    "body": "We’ve covered the basic opcodes required to map simple drum instruments onanother page, and here we are going to apply thatknowledge to pitched instruments, plus add more opcodes. Let’s say we want tosample a folk flute whose lowest note is a D. If the lowest five notes areD, E, F#, G and A, and there is one sample available for each note, they couldbe mapped like this: &lt;region&gt;key=50 sample=d4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=52 sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=f#4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=55 sample=g4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=57 sample=a4. wavThis would work well enough to make a sound when a MIDI note corresponding toone of the sampled pitches is played. However, playing notes inbetweenthe D and E, or E and F#, would mean no sound. We can “stretch” one of theneighboring notes to cover that D# and that F using thelokey, hikey andpitch_keycenter opcodes instead of key. If a sample does not need to cover multiple notes, it can still use key. Whetherto use the D or E sample to cover the D# in our example is a judgment call -which sounds better? &lt;region&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sample=d4. wav&lt;region&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=f#4. wav&lt;region&gt;lokey=55 hikey=55 pitch_keycenter=56 sample=g4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=57 sample=a4. wavThe samples will play as long as a note is held, but when the note is released,they will end suddenly, which is probably not realistic for a flute sound, orindeed most other instruments. We’ll need to apply a volume envelope with arelease time set, which can be applied to all regions. The ampeg_release opcode accomplishes this. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3&lt;region&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sample=d4. wav&lt;region&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=f#4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=55 sample=g4. wavIf we have samples at various dynamics, such as quiet and loud, we could usenote velocity to choose which sample is played - however, while this makesperfect sense for drum hits or piano notes, with instruments such as flute orviolin, it’s possible for the player to vary the dynamic level while a note isbeing sustained. This can be simulated with thexfin_loccN/xfin_hiccN andxfout_loccN/xfout_hiccN opcodes. Using only theD4 and E4 samples as an example, and controlling the dynamics with CC1 (mod wheel). The amp_veltrack opcode is set to 0,so that velocity does not affect volume. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127Now, CC1 would first fade in the quiet sample when it was between 0 and 42. From 43 to 85, the quiet sample is faded out and the medium sample faded in. From 86 to the max value of 127, the medium sample is faded out while the loudsample fades in. If we have multiple techniques or articulation sampled, forexample regular sustains and fluttertongue sustains, we need a way to switchbetween them. Each could be its own independent and complete SFZ file, and wecould just load the desired file into the player, but for convenience,especially in live performance, it’s good to load both at once and have a way ofswitching between them. One way is loccN/hiccNwhere which sample is triggered for a particular note depends on the value ofa MIDI CC - let’s use MIDI CC 11. Notice that the fluttertongue samples in this example have fewer dynamic layersthan the main sustain samples - it’s common for the “core” articulations of aninstrument to be sampled in more detail, and the SFZ format is flexible enoughto allow this, or even allow different amounts of dynamic layers or round robinsfor different notes within the same articulation. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 hicc11=63&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 hicc11=63&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 locc11=64&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 locc11=64&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127Another, probably more common, way is to use keyswitches.

However, it’ is quite common,especially with string instruments, to use a MIDI CC to control the dynamics ofsustained articulations, and velocity to control the dynamics of shortarticulations such as staccato. In those cases, the short articulations coulduse amp_veltrack set to 100 instead of 0, and generally be mapped in the sameway as the drums we’ve discussed before. The flute isa monophonic instrument in reality - you can’t play chords on it, while you canusing our SFZ here. For more realism, playing a note on this flute should muteany previously playing notes. To make an instrument which can only play one noteat a time, the group and off_byopcodes can be used. Although these can be used in more complex scenarios, for amonophonic instrument with no multiple microphone positions sampled, it’s enoughto put all samples in the same group, and have that group muted whenever a newnote from that group is played. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0 sw_lokey=48 sw_hikey=49 group=1 off_by=1&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127However, this cuts off the note suddenly, creating a gap before the next notecan reach full volume.

There are more possibilities - better legato, vibratoemulation, multiple microphone positions etc. - which we’ll describe later inanother part of this guide. Together with the information covered in drum basicsearlier, this should also be enough to make a basic sampled piano or guitar. "

With the SFZ 1 or SFZ 2spec, an instrument which uses sw_last to select articulations will not have adefault articulation preselected, meaning when loaded, it will play no sounduntil one of the keyswitches is pressed - only after that will the instrumentrespond to notes. The ARIA extensions include sw_defaultas a solution to this. The difference between this and sw_down is that sw_lastis a “sticky” keyswitch - after releasing the keyswitch note, it continues toaffect notes until another keyswitch is pressed. sw_down,on the other hand, is “non-sticky” and only affects notes played whilethe switch is held down.

An attack region is considered corresponding if it has the same MIDI note number,and the same velocity range, as the release region. The velocity which matters here isthe note-on velocity of the initial region - not the velocity of the note-off messagewhich triggers the release region. Round robins do not need to match, so it is possibleto for example have five round robins for releases and only four round robins forattacks. This corresponding attack region is then used to calculate the volume of the releaseregion based on the attack region’s velocity and rt_decay. If there is no correspondingattack region, or the corresponding attack region has finished playing due to reachingsample end etc, then the release region will not play. This is designed primarilydesigned for piano release samples. Setting trigger to release_key will trigger a sound on note release regardless ofwhether there is any corresponding attack region or not.

    "body": "This tutorial describes various methods of using one set of samples to emulatethe sound of larger numbers of instruments - making a small ensemble soundlarger, using one set of samples for both first and second violins, automaticallymultitracking guitars, synthesizer oscillator unison etc. Transposition: Let’s say we have only one sampled violin section, and need to use both first andsecond violins. Using just one octave of range for simplicity, this is our firstviolins example: &lt;global&gt;&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=60Using this for both first and second violins will result in two identical-soundingsections with the same timbre, but it’s easily possible to use the same samplestransposed, and get a different timbre. Instead of using the C4 sample to play C4,use the Db4 sample transposed down a half step to play C4. This can be done byusing lokey, hikey and pitch_keycenter opcodes instead of just key. &lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav lokey=47 hikey=47 pitch_keycenter=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav lokey=48 hikey=48 pitch_keycenter=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav lokey=49 hikey=49 pitch_keycenter=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav lokey=50 hikey=50 pitch_keycenter=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav lokey=51 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav lokey=52 hikey=52 pitch_keycenter=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav lokey=53 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav lokey=54 hikey=54 pitch_keycenter=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav lokey=55 hikey=55 pitch_keycenter=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav lokey=56 hikey=56 pitch_keycenter=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav lokey=57 hikey=57 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav lokey=58 hikey=58 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav lokey=59 hikey=59 pitch_keycenter=60Howerver, in most cases it’s easier to use the key and transpose opcodes instead,and set the transpose amount for all the transposed regions at once. &lt;global&gt;transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav key=47&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=59This still requires changing the key opcode for every region, however. Doingthis editing manually on large sample sets would be time-consuming, butthe old tool sfzed allows easily adding, subtracting or multiplying currentparameter values to regions, which becomes very useful when doing this withthousands of samples. This shifts the entire range of the instrument down by a half-step, though. Inorder to preserve the correct range, we can remove the transposed notes whichgot moved below the lowest pitch the instrument is capable of. That’s easy. Thetop range is more tricky - if we extend the highest note to cover its originalpitch as well, but then the same sample would be used for the same pitch byboth sections. So, we can instead use the next-to-highest note, transposed up. This might not sound very consistent with the rest, but under these limitations,it can be a reasonable compromise. &lt;global&gt;transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=60 transpose=1Transposition Values: In general, transposing downwards will result in a warmer sound, and transposingupwards will make the sound brighter and thinner. Transposing by more than a halfstep can be a good idea. In general, transposing by a minor third is a common wayto create a big change in timbre. Transposing by much more than a minor thirddoesn’t seem common outside of sound design not intended to be a realistic instrumentemulation. Transposing down by a minor third while preserving the range in our example, andfilling in the lost top of the range by transposing upwards might look like this: &lt;global&gt;transpose=-3&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=58 transpose=1&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=59 transpose=1&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=60 transpose=1Unison By Transposition: If we put both the original and transposed samples in the same SFZ file, each MIDInote will trigger two regions, and we now will have the sound of an ensemble whichis twice as large as what was actually sampled. &lt;group&gt;&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=60&lt;group&gt;transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=60 transpose=1Unison By Round Robin: For cases where the goal is to emulate overdubbed copies of the same instrumentwith the same timbre, rather than different instruments with different timbres,it’s still necessary to avoid triggering the same samples. This can be doneby using different round robins for each simultaneously playing sample. Thisis how guitar multitracking is often emulated. Using one note with four roundrobins as an example: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=4We can create two by offsetting the round robins like this: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=4&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=3The group headers aren’t necessary and everything could be under one group,but for organizational purposes, they can make things easier. Or three, or a maximum of four: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=4&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=3&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=2&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=1Note that this will not work well with random round robins, as it’spossible that the same sample will be randomly selected for multipleregions. Width And Detune: Multitracked guitars will often be spread in stereo, as will unison voicesin synthesizers etc. Spreading the above quad-tracked guitar in stereois simple: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48pan=-100&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=4&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48pan=100&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=3&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48pan=-50&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=2&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48pan=50&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=1It’s also possible to apply slight detuning to each voice. That’s probablynot common with guitars, and unnecessary with section recordings where naturaltuning differences will already be captured in the recordings, but it is verycommon in synthesizers, and can also be helpful when trying to turn soloinstrument samples into a small section. Detune can even be used by itselfto create multiple voices, and this is an especially viable approach forsynthesizers. The amount of detune, as well as width, can be modulated. Hereis an example of a saw oscillator with seven voices. &lt;region&gt;sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=20 pan_oncc101=100 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=-20 pan_oncc101=-100 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=30 pan_oncc101=67 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=-30 pan_oncc101=-67 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=40 pan_oncc101=33 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=-40 pan_oncc101=-33 sample=*sawLegato: This is just a reminder that with legato, each set of unison samples willneed to have its own polyphony groups, same as would be needed with multiplemicrophone positions. Humanization: When trying to emulate the sound of a larger section of instruments, especially whentrying to turn a solo instrument into an emulated section, it can be useful tocreate small differences between each voice, especially when vibrato and legatoare also emulated. This is probably not that important with sampled ensembles, suchas emulating second violins, but with solo instruments it becomes crucial. Withoutindependent per-voice humanization, emulated vibrato and legato can sound more likea solo instrument run through a chorus or other doubling effect, rather than separateperformances. Aspects of the sound which can be humanized or randomized include timing, smoothing,phase, pitch, vibrato speed and vibrato depth. Here is a rather lengthy example, adapted from a real instrument, where each voice hasseparate pan settings for stereo spread and separate polyphony groups - these are basicfeatures of unison, and not related to humanization, of course. The humanizingdifferences between the voices are differences in bend smoothing, in maximum vibratodepth, in the initial phase of the vibrato humanization LFOs, and in the fade times ofthe legato regions. The shallower vibrato and slower legato of the transposed regionsemulate less confident, more hesitant players. &lt;global&gt;//Basic global stuff shared by all voicesampeg_release=0. 25ampeg_attack_oncc106=1ampeg_release_oncc107=1. 25off_mode=normalbend_down=-1200bend_up=1200//Pitch bend smoothing is set separately for each voiceamplitude_oncc100=100amplitude_smoothcc1=100locc100=1amp_veltrack=0loop_mode=loop_continuous//Vibrato//Pitch LFO depth is set separately for each voicelfo01_freq=2 //Any slower than this sounds really lousylfo01_freq_oncc112=6 //8 Hz is about as fast as vibrato on cello can golfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500//This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc21=1 //Not much - just a subtle effect on volumeeq1_freq=2200 //EQ band for vibratoeq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc21=3 //Again, pretty subtlelfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblier//Initial phase is set separately for each voicelfo02_phase_oncc131=0. 7 //Phase affected by velocity, to pseudo-randomize while keeping both mics' LFOs in synclfo02_freq=0. 01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobblinesslfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=0. 2 lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc112=0. 8 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobbliness//Initial phase is set separately for each voicelfo03_phase_oncc131=0. 479 //Different phase response to velocity than the second LFOlfo03_freq=0. 5lfo03_freq_oncc117=-0. 4lfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1lfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4&lt;master&gt;//Central voicebend_smooth=80lfo01_pitch_oncc21=29lfo02_phase=0lfo03_phase=0. 4group=1off_by=1//Sustains legato&lt;group&gt;trigger=first#include  mappings/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatooffset=5000 offset_random=500ampeg_attack=0. 5ampeg_vel2attack=-0. 35#include  mappings/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;//Left voice using sample maps transposed by a half-step//Pan control not used in the central voicepan_oncc101=-100//Values different than the central voice, for humanization purposesbend_smooth=91lfo01_pitch_oncc21=17lfo02_phase=0. 05lfo03_phase=0. 3group=2off_by=2//Sustains legato&lt;group&gt;trigger=first#include  mappings/t1/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatooffset=5000 offset_random=500//Values different than the central voice, for humanization purposesampeg_attack=0. 55ampeg_vel2attack=-0. 4#include  mappings/t1/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;//Right voice using sample maps transposed by a whole step//Pan control not used in the central voicepan_oncc101=100//Values different than the central voice, for humanization purposesbend_smooth=87lfo01_pitch_oncc21=19lfo02_phase=0. 02lfo03_phase=0. 28group=3off_by=3//Sustains legato&lt;master&gt;trigger=first#include  mappings/t2/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;trigger=legatooffset=5000 offset_random=500//Values different than the central voice, for humanization purposesampeg_attack=0. 58ampeg_vel2attack=-0. 43#include  mappings/t2/ord_sus_map. sfz Round Robin Neighbor Borrowing: Although not a method of achieving unison, round robin neighbor borrowingis another use of transposition, which likewise milks more out of a limitedset of samples - specifically, emulating round robins where there are none,or increasing the amonut of available round robins. This works with either sequential round robin and random round robinapproaches, or both at once. Let’s use sequential round robins for thisexample, with a very small note range and three round robins sampled. &lt;global&gt;seq_length=3&lt;group&gt;seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr1. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr1. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr2. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr2. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr3. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr3. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr3. wav key=62We can double the amount of round robins by using a transposedsample from a neighboring note for every other note in thesequence. This means every other note repeat has a slightlydifferent timbre, but it should sound more acceptable thanusing untransposed notes for the first three sequence positionsand transposed notes for positions four through six. So, weincrease the sequence length to six, and alternate betweentransposed and untransposed samples like this: &lt;global&gt;seq_length=6&lt;group&gt;seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr1. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr1. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr1. wav key=60 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr1. wav key=61 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr1. wav key=62 transpose=1&lt;group&gt;seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr2. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr2. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr2. wav key=60 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr2. wav key=61 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr2. wav key=62 transpose=1&lt;group&gt;seq_position=5&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr3. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr3. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr3. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=6&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr3. wav key=60 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr3. wav key=61 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr3. wav key=62 transpose=1It’s also possible to triple the amount of round robins byborrowing neighbors in both upwards and downwards directionfor each note (except the lowest and highest note in the range,of course). In general, transposing by more than a half-stepis not a good idea, as the timbral differences grow larger withlarger transposition, but with some instruments it can bepossible to get away with it. If there are many dynamic layersavailable, it’s also possible to borrow from nearby dynamic layers,especially in the case of drums. "

For the purpose of this website, anything included in the SFZ v2 regressiontests is considered SFZ v2, regardless of which SFZ players it might or mightnot be actually implemented in. If something works in both ARIA and Cakewalk,then it’s also considered SFZ v2 on this website, though it might not be anofficial, de jure standard. If something works in a Cakewalk product, such asRapture, but not in ARIA that’s considered a Cakewalk extension. If somethingworks in ARIA but not in any Cakewalk products, that’s considered an ARIA extension. The Simon Cann’s Cakewalk Synthesizers is not a recent book,and was not intended to be a standards document, but rather a manualfor users of Cakewalk products. So, if you are developing a new SFZ player,do not feel obligated to support [all opcodes] listed in this website -instead, use your judgment.

    "title": "Vibrato",
    "body": "Emulating vibrato for solo instruments or voices with LFOs is not difficult. The challengesare understanding the key aspects of vibrato on the real instrument, and keeping the number ofparameters from growing too large to be easy to use. The examples here use SFZ 2 spec numberedLFOs, rather than the dedicated pitch, volume and filter LFOsand envelopes of SFZ 1. A lot of this can be done under the SFZ 1 specification as well, butthere are some limitations. The most basic, typical vibrato is pitch vibrato - just an LFO modulating pitch. Making theminimum and maximum rates and depths that would be used by players in real life is important,of course. The numbers here are examples which would be decent for bowed strings - it has arate of 2-10 Hz and a maximum depth of 35 cents. Wider and slower are certainly possibleon real instruments, but isn’t commonly used in performance. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8In real life, however, players and singers will often start a note without vibrato,and add vibrato a fraction of a second later. This is where modulating the LFO delay parameterbecomes useful, and possibly LFO fade as well. Delay seems like enough for most windinstruments and vocals, but having both delay and fade seems effective with bowed strings. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500Vibrato on many instruments doesn’t just affect pitch; on bowed strings, it seems to havea subtle effect on volume and timbre as well. We can have the same MIDI CC parameter controlhow much the vibrato LFO affects pitch, volume, and an EQ band, with the latter two beingquite subtle. This is a good a time as any to note that not all vibrato is equal - it’s not reallypractical to add vibrato to the lowest note playable on a cello, for example, or to anatural harmonic. With pizzicato, vibrato is possible, but probably should not affect theEQ band, and either only affect pitch or pitch plus a subtle effect on volume. The belowwill work reasonably for most bowed notes, however. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_volume_oncc111=1lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500eq1_freq=2000eq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc111=2lfo01_eq1freq_oncc111=500Vibrato can also be humanized, by varying the rate of the vibrato LFO. This can be doneby modulating the rate of the vibrato LFO with another LFO. The ARIA sample &amp; holdwaveform can be used here, and the modulation depth controlled by MIDI CC, so when that’sat zero, no humanization happens. lfo02_freq=1lfo02_wave=12 //Sample &amp; hold LFO waveform numberlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1Or, to stay in the SFZ 2 spec and not use ARIA extensions, a sine wave with randomizedstarting phase will also work: lfo02_freq=1lfo02_phase_oncc135=1lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1However, when playing multiple layers, such as sustain samples with crossfaded dynamicsor multiple mic positions, this can cause each layer’s vibrato to drift out of sync andsound like separate instruments. This is generally not desirable, so it is possible topseudo-randomize the starting phase using a non-random CC, such as velocity(which is often otherwise unused in sustain sounds with crossfaded dynamics). If the SFZplayer can have a global sample and hold LFO which does not retrigger for each note, thiswould also be a solution, though ARIA does not allow this. lfo02_freq=1lfo02_phase_oncc132=0. 7lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1For additional complexity, it’s also possible to have the random LFO itself modulate pitch,which will create some pitch drift, and have more than two LFOs involved. Here is a fairlysophisticated example. //Vibratolfo01_pitch_oncc21=29 //Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2 //Any slower than this sounds really lousylfo01_freq_oncc112=6 //8 Hz is about as fast as vibrato on cello can golfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500//This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc21=1 //Not much - just a subtle effect on volumeeq1_freq=2200 //EQ band for vibratoeq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc21=3 //Again, pretty subtlelfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblierlfo02_phase=0lfo02_phase_oncc131=0. 7 //Phase affected by velocity, to pseudo-randomize while keeping both mics' LFOs in synclfo02_freq=0. 01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobblinesslfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobblinesslfo03_phase=0. 4lfo03_phase_oncc131=0. 479 //Different phase response to velocity than the second LFOlfo03_freq=0. 5lfo03_freq_oncc117=-0. 4lfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1lfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4Something similar to the above will work fairly well for a range of strings and voices. However, there are cases where vibrato should only go in one direction - for example,bending guitar strings only moves the pitch upwards, while on saxophone it’s possibleto play vibrato centered around the pitch, but most of the time players will go onlybelow the pitch. Let’s use saxophone vibrato as an example. To have vibrato which will go below the main pitch is simple - the LFO phase can beset so the wave starts at the top, and the note tuned down by the vibrato depth amount. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20lfo01_phase=0. 25lfo01_freq=1. 5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6pitch_oncc111=-20This will work fine, as long as we don’t try to apply delay or fade to the LFO, whichwould result in the note starting out flat with no vibrato. To solve that problem, wecan combine the LFO with a pitch envelope. Here is an example with just delay: lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20lfo01_freq=1. 5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0. 25lfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20To have the choice of idiomatic sax vibrato and violin-style vibrato centered around the pitchcan be done separate LFOs and separate depth controls. It’s also possible to duplicate all theregions and use loccN/hiccN to select between ones with different styles of vibrato. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Sax vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=1. 5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0. 25 //Starts at toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20lfo02_pitch_oncc114=20 //Violin vibrato LFO - goes below and above main pitchlfo02_freq=1. 5lfo02_freq_oncc112=6 //Same rate as the first LFOlfo02_phase=0. 5 //Starts in the middle, goes down first before going uplfo02_delay_oncc116=1 //Same delay, tooThis covers jaw vibrato, but sax players also use diaphragm vibrato, which changes volumeand has no effect on pitch, which means there are now three vibrato depths. Having thevolume modulated by the second LFO is a little easier, as the phase setting of the firstLFO would mean having to apply a volume envelope as well. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Sax vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=1. 5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0. 25 //Starts at toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20lfo02_pitch_oncc114=20 //Violin vibrato LFO - goes below and above main pitchlfo02_freq=1. 5lfo02_freq_oncc112=6 //Same rate as the first LFOlfo02_delay_oncc116=1 //Same delay, toolfo02_phase=0. 5 //Starts in the middle, goes down first before going uplfo02_volume=0 //This LFO also does tremololfo02_volume_oncc113=3There is one additional consideration with diaphragm vibrato - whenthe volume of the note drops down, the breath noise can become more prominent, especially onquiet notes or when using the subtone technique. If the volume of the breath noise can bemodulated separately, the noise regions should not be affected by pitch vibrato, and beaffected by the diaphragm vibrato in an opposite direction to the notes. So, if the abovevibrato settings are set under a global header, the breath noisesample regions could have settings similar to this. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=0 //LFOs do not affect pitchpitcheg_depth_oncc111=0lfo02_pitch_oncc114=0lfo02_volume_oncc113=-3 //Diaphragm vibrato affects volume in the opposite directionHumanization and having the diaphragm vibrato affect timbre can be done similarly as withthe strings above, ensuring both LFOs are humanized in sync with each other, so they do notdrift apart. Some instruments will have vibrato types which require special treatment, for example guitartremolo bridges will bend each string’s pitch by a different amount when playing chords. Thisrequires different pitch modulation depths for each string. Vibrato can also be used tomodulate filter cutoffs, which is commonly used in synthesizers to createevolving pads or wobble basses. This is not difficult to implement. Here is an example of asynthesizer style vibrato with a typical lowpass filter, and vibrato which can affect pitch,volume or filter cutoff. //Filter//Lowpass filtercutoff=120cutoff_cc120=13200fil_keytrack=100resonance=0resonance_cc121=12//Vibratolfo01_freq=1lfo01_freq_oncc112=11lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFO affects pitchlfo01_volume_oncc114=6 //Volume tremololfo01_cutoff=0 //Filter wobblelfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600This by no means exhausts all the possibilties of vibrato. It does provide a decent combination of control and realism for a lot of common instrument types. "

GitHub and Travis-CI: The webpage is hosted on GitHub using Git SCMas content management, using 2 git repositories: source and master. The source repository is used for the website source files written in Markdownformat and Liquid language, which are used by Jekyll,a static pages website generator created and used by GitHub for hostingproject websites. The master repository is used to store the generated files that are builtexternally by Travis Continuous Integration service. Travis-CI was choosed instead GitHub Pages to enable the use of Jekyll customplugins required for our purposes, following their GitHub Pages Deploymentdocumentation. Rules:    Start any . md file with a 2 triple-dashed lines front matter,otherwise Jekyll will copy the original md file into the resulting _sitedirectory.   Opcode files should include:      a layout: sfz/opcode variable to specify therequired layout to build the resulting html page   the page language code if it’s not English   optionally, the title of the page if different than the page name(see the example below).       Each opcode file must have also an entry in the syntax. yml db file.     Using block code three back ticks even with a single line, inline code is usedfor opcode keywords highlights.     Using spaces instead of tabs for indentation in pages, mostly on _config. ymlto avoid issues / unwanted results.     Using 80 characters per line limit for a better reading.     Using a naming convention for numbered opcodes starting with N following withX Y Z, e. g. : egN_timeX_onccY     Don’t use ‘&lt;’ and ‘&gt;’ in md files to avoid the parser to generate wrong htmlcode, use ‘‹’ and ‘›’ instead.  Content: Opcode File Example: In case the opcode doesn’t have any modulation and it has some associatedopcode like on_loccN / on_hiccN, then using title is the right choice. Otherwise use opcode_name, so a modulation documentation file (a symlink to theopcode it modulates in source code) will use the correct references. &lt;?prettify?&gt; ---layout:  sfz/opcode title:  lovel / hivel ---(Here the auto-generated brief text description from syntax. yml db. . . )This is just an example for an opcode extended description to be written in some/opcodes/lovel. md markdown file.

YAML Configuration Files: The main _config. yml configuration file is placed in the root of the source repo. It is used by Jekyll to store its configuration options, but it can also be usedfor user custom options as well. Other configuration files are placed in the _data directory, used for otherwebsite contexts, like translation strings, navigation menu, aside blocks,and other SFZ related data files. Translation files: The /_data/locale/ directory contains all files used for websitelanguage translation subdivided by language codes as subdirectories. Currently each language translation subdirectory contains 2 files:  layout. yml: contains both the navigation menu links and the aside card blocks strings translation. yml: contains all the language related translation strings used by default in the website pages. layout. yml navigation and cards section: The navigation section is used by the _includes/navigation. html layout pageto build the navigation menu. It recognizes the following variable structure:  title: The menu title type: The menu type, can be normal for simple links or dropdown for submenus,    identified by an arrow down icon.  url:  Normal links only, the URL of the link.  pages: Submenus container. An empty item, using just a hyphen,    creates a menu separator. The cards section is used by the _includes/cards. html layout page to buildthe aside card blocks on the right side of most of the website pages to placevarious internal and external links. It’s very similar to the navigation one with few differences:  title: The card header title icon_type: A Font Awesome icon type name, e. g. “github” icon_category: The category of the FA icon     fas: solid icon   fab: brand icon    links: The contained card links.
